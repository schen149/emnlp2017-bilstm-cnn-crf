O	That

O	the

O	,

O	,
O	if

O	hype
O	by

O	The

O	make

O	long
O	for
O	a
O	rerun
O	of
O	the
O	crash
O	of
O	1987
O	.

O	Let

O	make
O	that
O	1929
O	,
O	just
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	.

O	According
O	to
O	the
O	program
O	's
O	publicity
O	prospectus
O	,
O	``
O	Capital

O	set

O	a

O	guilty
O	of
O	less
O	than
O	full
O	disclosure
O	.

O	The
O	slickly
O	produced
O	series
O	has
O	been
O	criticized
O	by
O	London
O	's
O	financial
O	cognoscenti
O	as
O	inaccurate
O	in
O	detail
O	,
O	but
O	its
O	major
O	weakness
O	is
O	its
O	unrealistic
O	depiction
O	of
O	the
O	characters
O	'
O	professional
O	and
O	private
O	lives
O	.

O	Turned
O	loose
O	in
O	Shane
O	Longman
O	's
O	trading
O	room
O	,
O	the
O	yuppie
O	dealers
O	do
O	little
O	right
O	.

O	Judging
O	by
O	the
O	money
O	lost
O	and
O	mistakes
O	made
O	in
O	the
O	early
O	episodes
O	,
O	Shane
O	Longman
O	's
O	capital
O	should
O	be
O	just
O	about
O	exhausted
O	by
O	the
O	final
O	13th
O	week
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	opening
O	episode
O	we
O	learn
O	that
O	Michelle
O	,
O	a
O	junior
O	bond
O	trader
O	,
O	has
O	indeed
O	pulled
O	off
O	another
O	million
O	before
O	lunch
O	.

O	Trouble
O	is
O	,
O	she
O	has
O	lost
O	it
O	just
O	as
O	quickly
O	.

O	Rather
O	than
O	keep
O	the
O	loss
O	a
O	secret
O	from
O	the
O	outside
O	world
O	,
O	Michelle
O	blabs
O	about
O	it
O	to
O	a
O	sandwich
O	man
O	while
O	ordering
O	lunch
O	over
O	the
O	phone
O	.

O	Little
O	chance
O	that
O	Shane
O	Longman
O	is
O	going
O	to
O	recoup
O	today
O	.

O	Traders
O	spend
O	the
O	morning
O	frantically
O	selling
O	bonds
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	belief
O	that
O	the
O	U.S.
O	monthly
O	trade
O	figures
O	will
O	look
O	lousy
O	.

O	Ah
O	,
O	perfidious
O	Columbia
O	!

O	The
O	trade
O	figures
O	turn
O	out
O	well
O	,
O	and
O	all
O	those
O	recently
O	unloaded
O	bonds
O	spurt
O	in
O	price
O	.

O	So
O	much
O	for
O	anticipating
O	the
O	market
O	by
O	a
O	fraction
O	of
O	a
O	second
O	.

O	And
O	a
O	large
O	slice
O	of
O	the
O	first
O	episode
O	is
O	devoted
O	to
O	efforts
O	to
O	get
O	rid
O	of
O	some
O	nearly
O	worthless
O	Japanese
O	bonds
O	-LRB-
O	since
O	when
O	is
O	anything
O	Japanese
O	nearly
O	worthless
O	nowadays
O	?
O	-RRB-
O	.

O	Surprisingly
O	,
O	Shane
O	Longman
O	survives
O	the
O	week
O	,
O	only
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	senior
O	executive
O	innocently
O	bumble
O	his
O	way
O	into
O	becoming
O	the
O	target
O	of
O	a
O	criminal
O	insider
O	trading
O	investigation
O	.

O	Instead
O	of
O	closing
O	ranks
O	to
O	protect
O	the
O	firm
O	's
O	reputation
O	,
O	the
O	executive
O	's
O	internal
O	rivals
O	,
O	led
O	by
O	a
O	loutish
O	American
O	,
O	demand
O	his
O	resignation
O	.

O	The
O	plot
O	is
O	thwarted
O	when
O	the
O	firm
O	's
O	major
O	stockholder
O	,
O	kelp
O	farming
O	on
O	the
O	other
O	side
O	of
O	the
O	globe
O	,
O	hurries
O	home
O	to
O	support
O	the
O	executive
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	investigation
O	continues
O	.

O	If
O	you
O	can
O	swallow
O	the
O	premise
O	that
O	the
O	rewards
O	for
O	such
O	ineptitude
O	are
O	six-figure
O	salaries
O	,
O	you
O	still
O	are
O	left
O	puzzled
O	,
O	because
O	few
O	of
O	the
O	yuppies
O	consume
O	very
O	conspicuously
O	.

O	In
O	fact
O	,
O	few
O	consume
O	much
O	of
O	anything
O	.

O	Two
O	share
O	a
O	house
O	almost
O	devoid
O	of
O	furniture
O	.

O	Michelle
O	lives
O	in
O	a
O	hotel
O	room
O	,
O	and
O	although
O	she
O	drives
O	a
O	canary-colored
O	Porsche
O	,
O	she
O	has
O	n't
O	time
O	to
O	clean
O	or
O	repair
O	it
O	;
O	the
O	beat-up
O	vehicle
O	can
O	be
O	started
O	only
O	with
O	a
O	huge
O	pair
O	of
O	pliers
O	because
O	the
O	ignition
O	key
O	has
O	broken
O	off
O	in
O	the
O	lock
O	.

O	And
O	it
O	takes
O	Declan
O	,
O	the
O	obligatory
O	ladies
O	'
O	man
O	of
O	the
O	cast
O	,
O	until
O	the
O	third
O	episode
O	to
O	get
O	past
O	first
O	base
O	with
O	any
O	of
O	his
O	prey
O	.

O	Perhaps
O	the
O	explanation
O	for
O	these
O	anomalies
O	is
O	that
O	class-conscious
O	Britain
O	is
O	n't
O	ready
O	to
O	come
O	to
O	terms
O	with
O	the
O	wealth
O	created
O	by
O	the
O	Thatcherian
O	free-enterprise
O	regime
O	.

O	After
O	all
O	,
O	this
O	is
O	n't
O	old
O	money
O	,
O	but
O	new
O	money
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	many
O	cases
O	,
O	young
O	money
O	.

O	This
O	attitude
O	is
O	clearly
O	illustrated
O	in
O	the
O	treatment
O	of
O	Max
O	,
O	the
O	trading
O	room
O	's
O	most
O	flamboyant
O	character
O	.

O	Yuppily
O	enough
O	,
O	he
O	lives
O	in
O	a
O	lavishly
O	furnished
O	converted
O	church
O	,
O	wears
O	designer
O	clothes
O	and
O	drives
O	an
O	antique
O	car
O	.

O	But
O	apparently
O	to
O	make
O	him
O	palatable
O	,
O	even
O	lovable
O	,
O	to
O	the
O	masses
O	,
O	the
O	script
O	inflates
O	pony-tailed
O	Max
O	into
O	an
O	eccentric
O	genius
O	,
O	master
O	of
O	11
O	Chinese
O	dialects
O	.

O	He
O	takes
O	his
O	wash
O	to
O	the
O	laundromat
O	,
O	where
O	he
O	meets
O	a
O	punky
O	French
O	girl
O	who
O	dupes
O	him
O	into
O	providing
O	a
O	home
O	for
O	her
O	pet
O	piranha
O	and
O	then
O	promptly
O	steals
O	his
O	car
O	and
O	dumps
O	it
O	in
O	Dieppe
O	.

O	In
O	producing
O	and
O	promoting

O	City
O	,

O	Thames
O	has
O	spent
O	about

O	Longman
O	loses
O	on
O	a
O	good
O	day
O	.

O	and

O	of

O	He
O	is

O	that

O	.

O	Perhaps
O	without

O	it
O	,
O	Mr.

O	simultaneously
O	has
O	put

O	:

O	If
O	only
O	we
O	could
O	get
O	America
O	's
O	wastrel
O	youth
O	into
O	at
O	least
O	a
O	psychic
O	uniform
O	we
O	might
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	teach
O	self-discipline
O	again
O	and
O	revive
O	the
O	spirit
O	of
O	giving
O	.

O	A
O	quarter
O	of
O	a
O	century
O	ago
O	national
O	service
O	was
O	promoted
O	as
O	a
O	way
O	of
O	curing
O	the
O	manifest
O	inequities
O	of
O	the
O	draft
O	--
O	by
O	,
O	of
O	all
O	things
O	,
O	expanding
O	the
O	draft
O	.

O	Those
O	of
O	us
O	who
O	resisted
O	the
O	idea
O	then
O	suspect
O	today
O	that
O	an
O	obligation
O	of
O	government
O	service
O	for
O	all
O	young
O	people
O	is
O	still
O	the
O	true
O	long-term
O	aim
O	of
O	many
O	national-service
O	backers
O	,
O	despite
O	their
O	protests
O	that
O	present
O	plans
O	contain
O	no
O	coercion
O	.

O	Choice
O	of
O	the
O	volunteer
O	military
O	in
O	the
O	1970s
O	seemed
O	to
O	doom
O	national
O	service
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	the
O	draft
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	virus
O	was
O	kept
O	alive
O	in
O	sociology
O	departments
O	until
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	years
O	ago
O	,
O	when
O	it
O	again
O	was
O	let
O	loose
O	.

O	This
O	time
O	it
O	attempted
O	to
O	invade
O	two
O	connected
O	problems
O	,
O	the
O	rising
O	cost
O	of
O	higher
O	education
O	and
O	the
O	rising
O	expense
O	to
O	the
O	federal
O	government
O	of
O	educational
O	grants
O	and
O	loans
O	.

O	Why
O	not
O	keep
O	and
O	even
O	expand
O	the
O	loans
O	and
O	grants
O	,
O	the
O	advocates
O	reasoned
O	,
O	but
O	require
O	some
O	form
O	of
O	service
O	from
O	each
O	recipient
O	?

O	Military
O	service
O	,
O	moreover
O	,
O	could
O	be
O	a
O	national-service
O	option
O	.

O	Thus
O	,
O	undoubtedly
O	it
O	was
O	hoped
O	that
O	the
O	new
O	strain
O	of
O	national
O	service
O	would
O	prove
O	contagious
O	,
O	infecting
O	patriotic
O	conservatives
O	,
O	pay-as-you-go
O	moderates
O	,
O	and
O	idealistic
O	liberals
O	.

O	The
O	Democratic
O	Leadership
O	Council
O	,
O	a
O	centrist
O	group
O	sponsoring
O	the
O	plan
O	,
O	surely
O	thought
O	it
O	might
O	help
O	the
O	party
O	to
O	attract
O	support
O	,
O	especially
O	among
O	college
O	students
O	and
O	their
O	parents
O	.

O	A
O	provision
O	allowing
O	grants
O	to
O	be
O	applied
O	to
O	first-home
O	purchases
O	was
O	added
O	to
O	appeal
O	to
O	those
O	who
O	had
O	had
O	enough
O	of
O	schooling
O	.

O	The
O	DLC
O	plan
O	envisaged
O	``
O	volunteers
O	''
O	planting
O	trees
O	,
O	emptying
O	bedpans
O	,
O	tutoring
O	children
O	,
O	and
O	assisting
O	librarians
O	for
O	$
O	100
O	a
O	week
O	,
O	tax
O	free
O	,
O	plus
O	medical
O	care
O	.

O	With
O	a
O	tax-free
O	$
O	10,000
O	voucher
O	payment
O	at
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	each
O	year
O	,
O	the
O	volunteers
O	would
O	be
O	making
O	a
O	wage
O	comparable
O	to
O	$
O	17,500
O	a
O	year
O	.

O	Mind
O	you
O	,
O	most
O	of
O	``
O	the
O	volunteers
O	''
O	would
O	be
O	unskilled
O	17
O	-
O	to
O	18-year-olds
O	,
O	some
O	not
O	even
O	high
O	school
O	graduates
O	,
O	and
O	many
O	saving
O	money
O	by
O	living
O	at
O	home
O	.

O	They
O	would
O	be
O	doing
O	better
O	financially
O	under
O	national
O	service
O	than
O	many
O	taxpayers
O	working
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	kinds
O	of
O	jobs
O	and
O	perhaps
O	supporting
O	families
O	.

O	As
O	it
O	happened
O	,
O	political
O	resistance
O	developed
O	among
O	educational
O	and
O	minority
O	interests
O	that
O	count
O	on
O	the
O	present
O	education
O	grant
O	system
O	,
O	so
O	the
O	national-service
O	devotees
O	decided
O	to
O	abandon
O	the
O	supposedly
O	crucial
O	principle
O	of
O	``
O	give
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	get
O	.
O	''

O	Opposition
O	to
O	national
O	service
O	from
O	the
O	Pentagon
O	,
O	which
O	wants
O	to
O	protect
O	its
O	own
O	recruitment
O	process
O	,
O	also
O	led
O	to
O	the
O	military-service
O	option
O	being
O	dropped
O	.

O	Clearly
O	,
O	a
O	new
O	rationale
O	for
O	national
O	service
O	had
O	to
O	be
O	cooked
O	up
O	.

O	What
O	better
O	place
O	to
O	turn
O	than
O	Sen.
O	Edward
O	Kennedy
O	's
O	Labor
O	Committee
O	,
O	that
O	great
O	stove
O	of
O	government
O	expansionism
O	,
O	where
O	many
O	a

O	until

O	In
O	this
O	case
O	,
O	the
O	new
O	recipe
O	for
O	national
O	service
O	called
O	for
O	throwing
O	many

O	into

O	Before
O	the
O	menu
O	is
O	printed
O	,
O	the
O	House
O	may
O	add
O	more
O	ingredients
O	,
O	also
O	changing
O	the
O	initial
O	price
O	,
O	now
O	posted
O	at
O	some
O	$
O	330
O	million
O	.

O	It
O	is
O	widely
O	known
O	that
O	``
O	too
O	many
O	cooks
O	spoil
O	the
O	broth
O	,
O	''
O	but
O	that
O	wisdom
O	does
O	not
O	necessarily
O	reflect
O	the
O	view
O	of
O	the
O	cooks
O	,
O	especially
O	if
O	they
O	are
O	senators
O	.

O	The
O	``
O	omnibus
O	''
O	bill
O	coming
O	out
O	of
O	Congress
O	may
O	be
O	unwholesome
O	glop
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	assorted
O	chefs
O	are
O	happy
O	and
O	the
O	restaurant
O	is
O	pushing
O	the
O	dish
O	very
O	hard
O	.

O	The
O	aroma
O	of
O	patronage
O	is
O	in
O	the
O	air
O	.

O	Is
O	the
O	voluntary
O	sector
O	so
O	weak
O	that
O	it
O	needs
O	such
O	unsolicited
O	assistance
O	?

O	On
O	the
O	contrary
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	as
O	robust
O	as
O	ever
O	.

O	According
O	to
O	the
O	Gallup
O	Poll
O	,
O	American
O	adults
O	contribute
O	an
O	average
O	of
O	two
O	hours
O	a
O	week
O	of
O	service
O	,
O	while
O	financial
O	contributions
O	to
O	charity
O	in
O	the
O	1980s
O	have
O	risen
O	30
O	%
O	-LRB-
O	adjusted
O	for
O	inflation
O	-RRB-
O	.

O	Even
O	if
O	government
O	does
O	see
O	various
O	``
O	unmet
O	needs
O	,
O	''
O	national
O	service
O	is
O	not
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	meet
O	them
O	.

O	If
O	we
O	want
O	to
O	support
O	students
O	,
O	we
O	might
O	adopt
O	the
O	idea
O	used
O	in
O	other
O	countries
O	of
O	offering
O	more
O	scholarships
O	based
O	on
O	something
O	called
O	``
O	scholarship
O	,
O	''
O	rather
O	than
O	on
O	the
O	government
O	's
O	idea
O	of
O	``
O	service
O	.
O	''

O	Or
O	we
O	might
O	provide
O	a
O	tax
O	credit
O	for
O	working
O	students
O	.

O	What
O	we
O	do
O	not
O	need
O	to
O	do
O	is
O	start
O	a
O	war
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	try
O	to
O	justify
O	it
O	by
O	creating
O	a
O	GI
O	Bill
O	.

O	To
O	the
O	extent
O	we
O	lack
O	manpower
O	to
O	staff
O	menial
O	jobs
O	in
O	hospitals
O	,
O	for
O	example
O	,
O	we
O	should
O	raise
O	pay
O	,
O	pursue
O	labor-saving
O	technology
O	,
O	or
O	allow
O	more
O	legal
O	immigration
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	overpay
O	high
O	school
O	graduates
O	as
O	short-term
O	workers
O	and
O	cause
O	resentment
O	among
O	permanent
O	workers
O	paid
O	lesser
O	amounts
O	to
O	do
O	the
O	same
O	jobs
O	.

O	Will
O	national
O	service
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	current
O	highly
O	politicized
O	and
O	opportunistic
O	form
O	exert
O	enough
O	appeal
O	to
O	get
O	adopted
O	?

O	Not
O	necessarily
O	.

O	Polls
O	show
O	wide
O	,
O	generalized
O	support
O	for
O	some
O	vague
O	concept
O	of
O	service
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	bill
O	now
O	under
O	discussion
O	lacks
O	any
O	passionate
O	public
O	backing
O	.

O	Nonetheless
O	,
O	Senate
O	Democrats
O	are
O	organizing
O	a
O	roll
O	of
O	supporting
O	``
O	associations
O	,
O	''
O	``
O	societies
O	''
O	and
O	``
O	councils
O	,
O	''
O	some
O	of
O	which
O	may
O	hope
O	to
O	receive
O	the
O	paid
O	``
O	volunteers
O	.
O	''

O	So
O	far
O	,
O	the
O	president
O	seems
O	ill-disposed
O	to
O	substitute
O	any
O	of
O	the
O	omnibus
O	for
O	his
O	own
O	free-standing
O	proposal
O	to
O	endow
O	a
O	``
O	Points
O	of
O	Light
O	''
O	foundation
O	with
O	$
O	25
O	million
O	to
O	inform
O	citizens
O	of
O	all
O	ages
O	and
O	exhort
O	them
O	to
O	genuine
O	volunteerism
O	.

O	However
O	,
O	even
O	this
O	admirable
O	plan
O	could
O	become
O	objectionable
O	if
O	the
O	White
O	House
O	gives
O	in
O	to
O	congressional
O	Democratic
O	pressure
O	to
O	add
O	to
O	the
O	scope
O	of
O	the
O	president
O	's
O	initiative
O	or
O	to
O	involve
O	the
O	independent
O	foundation
O	in
O	``
O	brokering
O	''
O	federal
O	funds
O	for
O	volunteer
O	projects
O	.

O	There
O	's
O	no
O	need
O	for
O	such
O	concessions
O	.

O	The
O	omnibus
O	can
O	be
O	defeated
O	,
O	the
O	virus
O	controlled
O	,
O	and
O	real
O	service
O	protected
O	.

O	National
O	service
O	,
O	the
O	utopian
O	idea
O	,
O	still
O	wo
O	n't
O	go
O	away
O	then
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	millions
O	of
O	knee-socked
O	youth
O	performing
O	works
O	of
O	``

O	content

O	The

O	over

O	has
O	begun
O	again
O	.

O	After
O	a

O	in

O	more

O	50
O	localities
O	established
O	their
O	own

O	or

O	a

O	,
O	the
O	focus
O	has
O	shifted
O	to

O	.

O	At
O	least
O	10
O	bills
O	proposing
O	one
O	or
O	another

O	were
O	introduced
O	in
O	Congress
O	this

O	.

O	One

O	Rep.
O	Dave
O	McCurdy
O	-LRB-

O	would

O	federal

O	An

O	Sens.
O	Claiborne
O	Pell
O	,
O	Barbara
O	Mikulski
O	and
O	Christopher
O	Dodd
O	,
O	has
O	been
O	reported
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	Senate
O	Labor
O	Committee
O	.

O	It
O	might
O	well
O	win
O	Senate
O	passage
O	.

O	President
O	Bush
O	has
O	outlined
O	his
O	own
O	Youth
O	Entering
O	Service
O	-LRB-
O	YES
O	-RRB-
O	plan
O	,
O	though
O	its
O	details
O	remain
O	to
O	be
O	specified
O	.

O	What
O	is
O	one
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	all
O	this
O	?

O	Doctrine
O	and
O	special
O	interests
O	govern
O	some
O	responses
O	.

O	People
O	eager
O	to
O	have
O	youth
O	``
O	pay
O	their
O	dues
O	to
O	society
O	''
O	favor
O	service
O	proposals
O	--
O	preferably
O	mandatory
O	ones
O	.

O	So
O	do
O	those
O	who
O	seek
O	a
O	``
O	re-energized
O	concept
O	of
O	citizenship
O	,
O	''
O	a
O	concept
O	imposing
O	stern
O	obligations
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	conferring
O	rights
O	.

O	Then
O	there
O	are
O	instinctive
O	opponents
O	.

O	To
O	libertarians
O	,
O	mandatory
O	service
O	is
O	an
O	abomination
O	and
O	voluntary
O	systems
O	are
O	illegitimate
O	uses
O	of
O	tax
O	money
O	.

O	Devotees
O	of
O	the
O	market
O	question
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	the
O	work
O	national
O	service
O	would
O	perform
O	:

O	If
O	the
O	market
O	wo
O	n't
O	pay
O	for
O	it
O	,
O	they
O	argue
O	,
O	it
O	ca
O	n't
O	be
O	worth
O	its
O	cost
O	.

O	Elements
O	of
O	the
O	left
O	are
O	also
O	reflexively
O	opposed
O	;
O	they
O	see
O	service
O	as
O	a
O	cover
O	for
O	the
O	draft
O	,
O	or
O	fear
O	the
O	regimentation
O	of
O	youth
O	,
O	or
O	want
O	to
O	see
O	rights
O	enlarged
O	,
O	not
O	obligations
O	.

O	But
O	what
O	about
O	those
O	of
O	us
O	whose
O	views
O	are
O	not
O	predetermined
O	by
O	formula
O	or
O	ideology
O	?

O	How
O	should
O	we
O	think
O	about
O	national
O	service
O	?

O	Let
O	's
O	begin
O	by
O	recognizing
O	a
O	main
O	source
O	of
O	confusion
O	--
O	``
O	national
O	service
O	''
O	has
O	no
O	agreed
O	meaning
O	.

O	Would
O	service
O	be
O	voluntary
O	or
O	compulsory
O	?

O	Short
O	or
O	long
O	?

O	Part-time
O	or
O	full-time
O	?

O	Paid
O	or
O	unpaid
O	?

O	Would
O	participants
O	live
O	at
O	home
O	and
O	work
O	nearby
O	or
O	live
O	in
O	barracks
O	and
O	work
O	on
O	public
O	lands
O	?

O	What
O	kinds
O	of
O	work
O	would
O	they
O	do
O	?

O	What
O	does
O	``
O	national
O	''
O	mean
O	?

O	Would
O	the
O	program
O	be
O	run
O	by
O	the
O	federal
O	government
O	,
O	by
O	local
O	governments
O	,
O	or
O	by
O	private
O	voluntary
O	organizations
O	?

O	And
O	who
O	would
O	serve
O	?

O	Only
O	males
O	,
O	as
O	with
O	the
O	draft
O	,
O	or
O	both
O	sexes
O	?

O	Youth
O	only
O	or
O	all
O	ages
O	?

O	Middle-class
O	people
O	,
O	or
O	poor
O	people
O	,
O	or
O	a
O	genuine
O	cross-section
O	?

O	Many
O	or
O	few
O	?

O	Those
O	are
O	not
O	trivial
O	questions
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	label
O	``
O	national
O	service
O	''
O	answers
O	none
O	of
O	them
O	.

O	Then
O	how
O	should
O	we
O	think
O	about
O	national
O	service
O	?

O	As
O	a
O	starting
O	point
O	,
O	here
O	are
O	five
O	propositions
O	:
O	1
O	.
O	Consider
O	the
O	ingredients
O	,
O	not
O	the
O	name
O	.

O	Ignore
O	``
O	national
O	service
O	''
O	in
O	the
O	abstract
O	;
O	consider
O	specific
O	proposals
O	.

O	They
O	will
O	differ
O	in
O	crucial
O	ways
O	.

O	2
O	.
O	``
O	Service
O	''
O	should
O	be
O	service
O	.

O	As
O	commonly
O	understood
O	,
O	service
O	implies
O	sacrifice
O	.

O	It
O	involves
O	accepting
O	risk
O	,
O	or
O	giving
O	up
O	income
O	,
O	or
O	deferring
O	a
O	career
O	.

O	It
O	follows
O	that
O	proposals
O	like
O	Nunn-McCurdy
O	,
O	whose
O	benefits
O	to
O	enrollees
O	are
O	worth
O	some
O	$
O	17,500
O	a
O	year
O	,
O	do
O	not
O	qualify
O	.

O	There
O	is
O	a
O	rationale
O	for
O	such
O	bills
O	:
O	Federal
O	subsidies
O	to
O	college
O	students
O	amount
O	to
O	``
O	a
O	GI
O	Bill
O	without
O	the
O	GI
O	''
O	;
O	arguably
O	those
O	benefits
O	should
O	be
O	earned
O	,
O	not
O	given
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	earnings
O	exceed
O	by
O	20
O	%
O	the
O	average
O	income
O	of
O	young
O	high-school
O	graduates
O	with
O	full-time
O	jobs
O	.

O	Why
O	call
O	that
O	service
O	?

O	3
O	.
O	Encouragement
O	is
O	fine
O	;
O	compulsion
O	is
O	not
O	.

O	Compelled
O	service
O	is
O	unconstitutional
O	.

O	It
O	is
O	also
O	unwise
O	and
O	unenforceable
O	.

O	-LRB-
O	Who
O	will
O	throw
O	several
O	hundred
O	thousand
O	refusers
O	in
O	jail
O	each
O	year
O	?
O	-RRB-

O	But
O	through
O	tax
O	policy
O	and
O	in
O	other
O	ways
O	the
O	federal
O	government
O	encourages
O	many
O	kinds
O	of
O	behavior
O	.

O	It
O	should
O	also
O	encourage
O	service
O	--
O	preferably
O	by
O	all
O	classes
O	and
O	all
O	ages
O	.

O	Its
O	encouragement
O	should
O	strengthen
O	and
O	not
O	undercut
O	the
O	strong
O	tradition
O	of
O	volunteering
O	in
O	the
O	U.S.
O	,
O	should
O	build
O	on
O	the
O	service
O	programs
O	already
O	in
O	existence
O	,
O	and
O	should
O	honor
O	local
O	convictions
O	about
O	which
O	tasks
O	most
O	need
O	doing
O	.

O	4
O	.
O	Good
O	programs
O	are
O	not
O	cheap
O	.

O	Enthusiasts
O	assume
O	that
O	national
O	service
O	would
O	get
O	important
O	work
O	done
O	cheaply
O	:
O	forest
O	fires
O	fought
O	,
O	housing
O	rehabilitated
O	,
O	students
O	tutored
O	,
O	day-care
O	centers
O	staffed
O	.

O	There
O	is
O	important
O	work
O	to
O	be
O	done
O	,
O	and
O	existing
O	service
O	and
O	conservation
O	corps
O	have
O	shown
O	that
O	even
O	youths
O	who
O	start
O	with
O	few
O	skills
O	can
O	do
O	much
O	of
O	it
O	well
O	--
O	but
O	not
O	cheaply
O	.

O	Good
O	service
O	programs
O	require
O	recruitment
O	,
O	screening
O	,
O	training
O	and
O	supervision
O	--
O	all
O	of
O	high
O	quality
O	.

O	They
O	involve
O	stipends
O	to
O	participants
O	.

O	Full-time
O	residential
O	programs
O	also
O	require
O	housing
O	and
O	full-time
O	supervision
O	;
O	they
O	are
O	particularly
O	expensive
O	--
O	more
O	per
O	participant
O	than
O	a
O	year
O	at
O	Stanford
O	or
O	Yale
O	.

O	Non-residential
O	programs
O	are
O	cheaper
O	,
O	but
O	good
O	ones
O	still
O	come
O	to
O	some
O	$
O	10,000
O	a
O	year
O	.

O	Are
O	they
O	worth
O	that
O	?

O	Evaluations
O	suggest
O	that
O	good
O	ones
O	are
O	--
O	especially
O	so
O	if
O	the
O	effects
O	on
O	participants
O	are
O	counted
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	calculations
O	are
O	challengeable
O	.

O	5
O	.
O	Underclass
O	youth
O	are
O	a
O	special
O	concern
O	.

O	Are
O	such
O	expenditures
O	worthwhile
O	,
O	then
O	?

O	Yes
O	,
O	if
O	targeted
O	.

O	People
O	of
O	all
O	ages
O	and
O	all
O	classes
O	should
O	be
O	encouraged
O	to
O	serve
O	,
O	but
O	there
O	are
O	many
O	ways
O	for
O	middle-class
O	kids
O	,
O	and
O	their
O	elders
O	,
O	to
O	serve
O	at
O	little
O	public
O	cost
O	.

O	They
O	can
O	volunteer
O	at
O	any
O	of
O	thousands
O	of
O	non-profit
O	institutions
O	,
O	or
O	participate
O	in
O	service
O	programs
O	required
O	by
O	high
O	schools
O	or
O	encouraged
O	by
O	colleges
O	or
O	employers
O	.

O	Underclass
O	youth
O	do
O	n't
O	have
O	those
O	opportunities
O	.

O	They
O	are
O	not
O	enrolled
O	in
O	high
O	school
O	or
O	college
O	.

O	They
O	are
O	unlikely
O	to
O	be
O	employed
O	.

O	And
O	they
O	have
O	grown
O	up
O	in
O	unprecedentedly
O	grim
O	circumstances
O	,
O	among
O	family
O	structures
O	breaking
O	down
O	,
O	surrounded
O	by
O	self-destructive
O	behaviors
O	and
O	bleak
O	prospects
O	.

O	But
O	many
O	of
O	them
O	can
O	be
O	quite
O	profoundly
O	reoriented
O	by
O	productive
O	and
O	disciplined
O	service
O	.

O	Some
O	wo
O	n't
O	accept
O	the
O	discipline
O	;
O	others
O	drop
O	out
O	for
O	other
O	reasons
O	.

O	But
O	some
O	whom
O	nothing
O	else
O	is
O	reaching
O	are
O	transformed
O	.

O	Learning
O	skills
O	,
O	producing
O	something
O	cooperatively
O	,
O	feeling
O	useful
O	,
O	they
O	are
O	no
O	longer
O	dependent
O	--
O	others
O	now
O	depend
O	on
O	them
O	.

O	Even
O	if
O	it
O	is
O	cheaper
O	to
O	build
O	playgrounds
O	or
O	paint
O	apartments
O	or
O	plant
O	dune-grass
O	with
O	paid
O	professionals
O	,
O	the
O	effects
O	on
O	the
O	young
O	people
O	providing
O	those
O	services
O	alter
O	the
O	calculation
O	.

O	Strictly
O	speaking
O	,
O	these
O	youth
O	are
O	not
O	performing
O	service
O	.

O	They
O	are
O	giving
O	up
O	no
O	income
O	,
O	deferring
O	no
O	careers
O	,
O	incurring
O	no
O	risk
O	.

O	But
O	they
O	believe
O	themselves
O	to
O	be
O	serving
O	,
O	and
O	they
O	begin
O	to
O	respect
O	themselves
O	-LRB-
O	and
O	others
O	-RRB-
O	,
O	to
O	take
O	control
O	of
O	their
O	lives
O	,
O	to
O	think
O	of
O	the
O	future
O	.

O	That
O	is
O	a
O	service
O	to
O	the
O	nation
O	.

O	It
O	is
O	what
O	federal
O	support
O	should
O	try
O	hardest
O	to
O	achieve
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Szanton

O	a
O	Carter
O	administration
O	budget
O	official
O	,
O	heads
O	his
O	own
O	Washington-based
O	strategic
O	planning

O	.

O	He

O	Government
O	officials
O	here
O	and
O	in
O	other
O	countries
O	laid
O	plans
O	through
O	the
O	weekend
O	to
O	head
O	off
O	a
O	Monday
O	market
O	meltdown
O	--
O	but
O	went
O	out
O	of
O	their
O	way
O	to
O	keep
O	their
O	moves
O	quiet
O	.

O	Federal
O	Reserve
O	Chairman
O	Alan
O	Greenspan
O	was
O	on
O	the
O	telephones
O	,
O	making
O	it
O	clear
O	to
O	officials
O	in
O	the
O	U.S.
O	and
O	abroad
O	that
O	the
O	Fed
O	was
O	prepared
O	to
O	inject
O	massive
O	amounts
O	of
O	money
O	into
O	the
O	banking
O	system
O	,
O	as
O	it
O	did
O	in
O	October
O	1987
O	,
O	if
O	the
O	action
O	were
O	needed
O	to
O	prevent
O	a
O	financial
O	crisis
O	.

O	And
O	at
O	the
O	Treasury
O	,
O	Secretary
O	Nicholas
O	Brady
O	talked
O	with
O	friends
O	and
O	associates
O	on
O	Wall
O	Street
O	while
O	Assistant
O	Secretary
O	David
O	Mullins
O	carefully
O	analyzed
O	data
O	on
O	the
O	Friday
O	market
O	plunge
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	officials
O	feared
O	that
O	any
O	public
O	announcements
O	would
O	only
O	increase
O	market
O	jitters
O	.

O	In
O	addition
O	,
O	officials
O	at
O	the
O	Fed
O	and
O	in
O	the
O	Bush
O	administration
O	decided
O	that
O	avoiding
O	overt
O	actions
O	and
O	statements
O	over
O	the
O	weekend
O	would
O	give
O	them
O	more
O	strength
O	and

O	should
O	Friday
O	's
O	market
O	drop
O	turn
O	into
O	this
O	morning

O	.

O	The

O	's
O	efforts
O	at

O	were
O	partly
O	foiled

O	Fed

O	was
O	surprised
O	by

O	,
O	according

O	sources
O	,
O	and
O	insisted
O	he

O	.

O	Nevertheless
O	,

O	were
O	reasonably
O	accurate
O	portrayals
O	of
O	the

O	's

O	played
O	in

O	Nevertheless

O	,
O	monitoring
O	events
O	as
O	they
O	unfolded
O	in
O	markets
O	around
O	the

O	.

O	The

O	was
O	expected

O	of
O	the
O	New
O	Zealand

O	markets
O	at

O	in

O	and

O	early
O	this
O	morning
O	in
O	Europe
O	.

O	Both
O	the

O	and
O	the

O	planned

O	keep
O	market
O	rooms
O	operating
O	throughout

O	to

O	.

O	In

O	prices
O	dropped
O	sharply
O	by
O	1.7
O	%
O	in
O	early
O	Monday
O	morning
O	trading
O	.

O	After
O	the
O	initial
O	slide
O	,
O	the
O	market
O	appeared
O	to
O	be
O	turning
O	around
O	but
O	by
O	early
O	afternoon
O	was
O	headed
O	lower
O	.

O	In
O	the

O	,
O	the

O	Secretary
O	Brady
O	,
O	Undersecretary
O	Robert
O	Glauber
O	and
O	Assistant

O	Mullins
O	.

O	The
O	three

O	on
O	the
O	so-called
O	Brady
O	Commission
O	,
O	headed
O	by
O	Mr.
O	Brady
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	established
O	after
O	the
O	1987
O	crash
O	to
O	examine
O	the
O	market
O	's
O	collapse
O	.

O	As
O	a
O	result
O	they
O	have
O	extensive
O	knowledge
O	in
O	financial
O	markets
O	,
O	and
O	financial
O	market
O	crises
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Brady
O	was
O	at

O	White
O	House
O	Friday
O	afternoon
O	when
O	the
O	stock
O	market
O	's
O	decline
O	began
O	.

O	He
O	was
O	quickly
O	on
O	the
O	phone
O	with
O	Mr.
O	Mullins
O	,
O	who
O	in
O	turn
O	was
O	talking
O	with
O	the
O	chairmen
O	of
O	the
O	New
O	York
O	and
O	Chicago
O	exchanges
O	.

O	Later
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Brady
O	phoned
O	Mr.
O	Greenspan
O	,
O	SEC
O	Chairman
O	Richard
O	Breeden
O	and
O	numerous
O	contacts
O	in
O	New
O	York
O	and
O	overseas
O	.

O	Aides
O	say
O	he
O	continued
O	to
O	work
O	the
O	phones
O	through
O	the
O	weekend
O	.

O	Administration
O	officials
O	say
O	President
O	Bush
O	was
O	briefed
O	throughout
O	Friday
O	afternoon
O	and
O	evening
O	,
O	even
O	after
O	leaving
O	for
O	Camp
O	David
O	.

O	He
O	had
O	frequent
O	telephone
O	consultations
O	with
O	Mr.
O	Brady
O	and
O	Michael
O	Boskin
O	,
O	chairman
O	of
O	the
O	counsel
O	of
O	economic
O	advisers
O	.

O	Government
O	officials
O	tried
O	throughout
O	the
O	weekend
O	to
O	render
O	a
O	business-as-usual
O	appearance
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	avoid
O	any
O	sense
O	of
O	panic
O	.

O	Treasury
O	Undersecretary
O	David
O	Mulford
O	,
O	for
O	instance
O	,
O	was
O	at
O	a
O	meeting
O	of
O	the
O	Business
O	Council
O	in
O	Hot
O	Springs
O	,
O	Va.
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	stock
O	market
O	fell
O	,
O	and
O	remained
O	there
O	through
O	the
O	following
O	day
O	.

O	And
O	as
O	of
O	last
O	night
O	,
O	Fed
O	Chairman
O	Greenspan
O	had
O	n't
O	canceled
O	his
O	plans
O	to
O	address
O	the
O	American
O	Bankers
O	Association
O	convention
O	in
O	Washington
O	at
O	10
O	a.m.
O	this
O	morning
O	.

O	Ironically
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Greenspan
O	was
O	scheduled
O	to
O	address
O	the
O	same
O	convention
O	in
O	Dallas
O	on
O	Oct.
O	20
O	,
O	1987
O	.

O	He
O	flew
O	to
O	Dallas
O	on
O	Oct.
O	19
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	market
O	plummeted
O	508
O	points
O	,
O	but
O	then
O	turned
O	around
O	the
O	next
O	morning
O	and
O	returned
O	to
O	Washington
O	without
O	delivering
O	his
O	speech
O	.


O	Following
O	is
O	a
O	weekly
O	listing
O	of

O	Put
O	down
O	that
O	phone
O	.

O	Walk
O	around
O	the
O	room
O	;
O	take
O	two
O	deep
O	breaths
O	.

O	Resist
O	the
O	urge
O	to
O	call
O	your
O	broker
O	and
O	sell
O	all
O	your
O	stocks
O	.

O	That
O	's
O	the
O	advice
O	of
O	most
O	investment
O	professionals
O	after
O	Friday
O	's
O	190-point
O	drop
O	in
O	the
O	Dow
O	Jones
O	Industrial
O	Average
O	.

O	No
O	one
O	can
O	say
O	for
O	sure
O	what
O	will
O	happen
O	today
O	.

O	And
O	investment
O	pros
O	are
O	divided
O	on
O	whether
O	stocks
O	will
O	perform
O	well
O	or
O	badly
O	in
O	the
O	next
O	six
O	months
O	.

O	But
O	they
O	're
O	nearly
O	unanimous
O	on
O	one
O	point
O	:
O	Do
O	n't
O	sell
O	into
O	a
O	panic
O	.

O	Investors
O	who
O	sold
O	everything
O	after
O	the
O	crash
O	of
O	1987
O	lived
O	to
O	regret
O	it
O	.

O	Even
O	after
O	Friday
O	's
O	plunge
O	,
O	the
O	Dow
O	Jones
O	Industrial
O	Average
O	was
O	48
O	%
O	above
O	where
O	it
O	landed
O	on
O	Oct.
O	19
O	two
O	years
O	ago
O	.

O	Panic
O	selling
O	also
O	was
O	unwise
O	during
O	other
O	big
O	declines
O	in
O	the
O	past
O	.

O	The
O	crash
O	of
O	1929
O	was
O	followed
O	by
O	a
O	substantial
O	recovery
O	before
O	the
O	great
O	Depression
O	and
O	awful
O	bear
O	market
O	of
O	the
O	1930s
O	began
O	.

O	The
O	``
O	October
O	massacres
O	''
O	of
O	1978
O	and
O	1979
O	were
O	scary
O	,
O	but
O	did
O	n't
O	lead
O	to
O	severe
O	or
O	sustained
O	downturns
O	.

O	Indeed
O	,
O	some
O	pros
O	see
O	Friday
O	's
O	plunge
O	,
O	plus
O	any
O	further
O	damage
O	that
O	might
O	occur
O	early
O	this
O	week
O	,
O	as
O	a
O	chance
O	for
O	bargain
O	hunting
O	.

B-CONTENT	``

O	.

O	On
O	the
O	one
O	hand
O	,
O	Mr.

O	says
O	,
O	it
O	would

O	''

O	On

O	hand
O	,
O	it

O	They

O	should

O	--
O	but
O	not
O	necessarily
O	right

O	.

O	Many
O	of

O	stress

O	can
O	be

O	,

O	,

O	done

O	On
O	Thursday
O	,
O	William
O	Fleckenstein
O	,
O	a
O	Seattle
O	money
O	manager
O	,
O	used
O	futures

O	to
O	place
O	a
O	bet
O	that
O	the
O	broad

O	averages
O	would
O	decline
O	.

O	He
O	thinks
O	the
O	underlying
O	inflation
O	rate
O	is
O	around
O	5
O	%
O	to
O	6
O	%
O	,
O	far
O	higher

O	In

O	in
O	gold
O	and
O	natural

O	stocks
O	,
O	partly
O	as
O	an

O	hedge
O	.

O	He
O	thinks
O	government

O	are
O	terrified
O	to
O	let
O	a

O	start
O	when
O	government
O	,

O	levels

O	high
O	.

O	So
O	he

O	the

O	will
O	err
O	on

O	slower
O	economic
O	growth
O	and
O	a
O	severe
O	weakening
O	in
O	the
O	manufacturing
O	sector
O	,
O	is
O	a
O	warning
O	sign
O	to
O	investors
O	.

O	One
O	strategy
O	for
O	investors
O	who
O	want
O	to
O	stay
O	in
O	but
O	hedge
O	their
O	bets
O	is
O	to
O	buy
O	``
O	put
O	''
O	options
O	,
O	either
O	on
O	the
O	individual
O	stocks
O	they
O	own
O	or
O	on
O	a
O	broad
O	market
O	index
O	.

O	A
O	put
O	option
O	gives
O	its
O	holder
O	the
O	right
O	-LRB-
O	but
O	not
O	the
O	obligation
O	-RRB-
O	to
O	sell
O	a
O	stock
O	-LRB-
O	or
O	stock
O	index
O	-RRB-
O	for
O	a
O	specified
O	price
O	-LRB-
O	the
O	strike
O	price
O	-RRB-
O	until
O	the
O	option
O	expires
O	.

O	Whether
O	this
O	insurance
O	is
O	worthwhile
O	depends
O	on
O	the
O	cost
O	of
O	an
O	option
O	.

O	The
O	cost
O	,
O	or
O	premium
O	,
O	tends
O	to
O	get
O	fat
O	in
O	times
O	of
O	crisis
O	.

O	Thus
O	,
O	buying
O	puts
O	after
O	a
O	big
O	market
O	slide
O	can
O	be
O	an
O	expensive
O	way
O	to
O	hedge
O	against
O	risk
O	.

O	The
O	prices
O	of
O	puts
O	generally
O	did
O	n't
O	soar
O	Friday
O	.

O	For
O	example
O	,
O	the
O	premium
O	as
O	a
O	percentage
O	of
O	the
O	stock
O	price
O	for
O	certain
O	puts
O	on
O	Eli
O	Lilly
O	&
O	Co.
O	moved
O	up
O	from
O	3
O	%
O	at
O	Thursday
O	's
O	close
O	to
O	only
O	3.3
O	%
O	at
O	Friday
O	's
O	close
O	,
O	even
O	though
O	the
O	shares
O	dropped
O	more
O	than
O	$
O	5.50
O	.

O	But
O	put-option
O	prices
O	may
O	zoom
O	when
O	trading
O	resumes
O	today
O	.

O	It
O	's
O	hard
O	to
O	generalize
O	about
O	a
O	reasonable
O	price
O	for
O	puts
O	.

O	But
O	investors
O	should
O	keep
O	in
O	mind
O	,
O	before
O	paying
O	too
O	much
O	,
O	that
O	the
O	average
O	annual
O	return
O	for
O	stock
O	holdings
O	,
O	long-term
O	,
O	is
O	9
O	%
O	to
O	10
O	%
O	a
O	year
O	;
O	a
O	return
O	of
O	15
O	%
O	is
O	considered
O	praiseworthy
O	.

O	Paying
O	,
O	say
O	,
O	10
O	%
O	for
O	insurance
O	against
O	losses
O	takes
O	a
O	deep
O	bite

O	return
O	.

O	A
O	deeper
O	market
O	plunge
O	today
O	could
O	give
O	them
O	their
O	first
O	test
O	.

O	A
O	further
O	slide
O	also
O	would
O	resurrect
O	debate

O	host
O	of
O	other
O	,
O	more
O	sweeping
O	changes
O	proposed
O	--
O	but
O	not

O	But

O	But
O	the
O	250-point
O	circuit

O	never
O	had
O	to

O	Board
O	of
O	Trade
O	's
O	Major
O	Market
O	Index
O	also
O	were
O	n't
O	triggered

O	The
O	MMI
O	and
O	the
O	S&P
O	500
O	are
O	the
O	two
O	major
O	indexes
O	used
O	by
O	program
O	traders
O	to
O	run
O	their
O	computerized
O	trading
O	strategies
O	.

O	The
O	programs
O	are
O	considered
O	by
O	many
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	major
O	cause
O	of
O	the
O	1987
O	crash
O	.

O	The
O	process
O	of
O	post-crash
O	reforms
O	began
O	with
O	calls
O	to
O	remake
O	the
O	markets
O	and
O	wound
O	up
O	a
O	year
O	later
O	with
O	a
O	series
O	of
O	rather
O	technical
O	adjustments
O	.

O	In
O	October
O	1987
O	,
O	just
O	after
O	the
O	market
O	drop
O	,
O	Washington
O	was
O	awash
O	in
O	talk
O	of
O	sweeping
O	changes
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	the
O	financial
O	markets
O	are
O	structured
O	and
O	regulated
O	.

O	Over
O	the
O	next
O	year
O	that
O	grand
O	agenda
O	was
O	whittled
O	down
O	to
O	a
O	series
O	of
O	steps
O	to
O	soften
O	big
O	stock
O	drops
O	by
O	interrupting
O	trading
O	to
O	give
O	market
O	players
O	time
O	to
O	pause
O	and
O	reconsider
O	positions
O	.

O	In
O	addition
O	,
O	limits
O	were
O	placed
O	on
O	computer-driven
O	trading
O	,
O	and
O	steps
O	were
O	taken
O	to
O	better
O	link
O	the
O	stock
O	and
O	futures
O	markets
O	.

O	Few
O	changes
O	were
O	made
O	in
O	the
O	way
O	the
O	markets
O	are
O	regulated
O	.

O	At
O	the
O	outset
O	the
O	prime
O	target
O	was
O	program
O	trading
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	much
O	discussed
O	but
O	little
O	understood
O	on
O	Capitol
O	Hill
O	.

O	There
O	were
O	also
O	calls
O	to
O	strip
O	the
O	stock
O	markets
O	of
O	``
O	derivative
O	''
O	products
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	stock-index
O	futures
O	and
O	options
O	,
O	which
O	Federal
O	Judge
O	Stanley
O	Sporkin
O	,
O	for
O	example
O	,
O	likened
O	to
O	``
O	barnacles
O	attached
O	to
O	the
O	basic
O	market
O	.
O	''

O	And
O	there
O	was
O	much
O	criticism
O	of
O	the
O	New
O	York
O	Stock
O	Exchange
O	's
O	system
O	of
O	having
O	stock
O	trades
O	flow
O	through
O	specialists
O	,
O	or
O	market
O	makers
O	.

O	When
O	the
O	Brady
O	Task
O	Force
O	's
O	powerful
O	analysis
O	of
O	the
O	crash
O	was
O	released
O	in
O	January
O	1988
O	,
O	it
O	immediately
O	reshaped
O	the
O	reformers
O	'
O	agenda
O	.

O	Arguing
O	that
O	the
O	separate
O	financial
O	marketplaces
O	acted
O	as
O	one
O	,
O	and
O	concluding
O	that
O	the
O	crash
O	had
O	``
O	raised
O	the
O	possibility
O	of
O	a
O	full-scale
O	financial
O	system
O	breakdown
O	,
O	''
O	the
O	presidential
O	task
O	force
O	called
O	for
O	establishing
O	a
O	super-regulator
O	to
O	oversee
O	the
O	markets
O	,
O	to
O	make
O	margins
O	consistent
O	across
O	markets
O	,
O	to
O	unify
O	clearing
O	systems
O	and
O	to
O	install
O	circuit
O	breakers
O	.

O	Only
O	the
O	last
O	of
O	those
O	recommendations
O	ever
O	was
O	implemented
O	.

O	The
O	Reagan
O	White
O	House
O	held
O	the
O	Brady
O	recommendations
O	at
O	arm
O	's
O	length
O	and
O	named
O	a
O	second
O	panel
O	--
O	the
O	Working
O	Group
O	on

O	Financial
O	Markets
O	--
O	to
O	review
O	its
O	analysis
O	and
O	those
O	of

O	crash
O	studies
O	.

O	In
O	May
O	1988
O	,
O	the
O	Working
O	Group
O	,
O	made
O	up

O	Commission
O	,
O	finally

O	After

O	of

O	dismissed

O	government
O	subsidies
O	were
O	a

O	The

O	The

O	The
O	aim
O	of
O	the

O	was
O	to
O	slice
O	economic

O	which
O	soared

O	Off
O	and
O	on
O	since
O	then
O	,
O	the

O	have
O	skirmished
O	in

O	.

O	And
O	Justin
O	,
O	in
O	a

O	,
O	says
O	,
B-CONTENT	``
I-CONTENT	Once
I-CONTENT	competitive
I-CONTENT	,
I-CONTENT	Sony
I-CONTENT	now
I-CONTENT	resorts
I-CONTENT	to

I-CONTENT	''

O	Sony
O	's
O	lawyer
O	insists
O	that
O	the
O	company
O	's
O	tactics
O	--
O	including
O	the
O	use
O	of
O	a
O	private
O	detective
O	posing
O	as
O	a
O	buyer
O	--
O	are
O	routine
O	in
O	such
O	matters
O	.

O	He
O	also
O	insists
O	that
O	Sony
O	,
O	no
O	less
O	than
O	others
O	,
O	has
O	a
O	legal
O	right
O	to
O	protect

O	in
O	this

O	mostly
O	the
O	colors
O	that
O	it
O	claims
O	make
O	My
O	First
O	Sony
O	products
O	distinctive
O	.

O	-LRB-
O	Justin
O	claims
O	it
O	began
O	using
O	the
O	same
O	colors
O	on
O	electronic
O	goods
O	for

O	long
O	before
O	Sony
O	entered

O	-RRB-

O	Whatever
O	its
O	merits
O	,
O	Sony
O	's
O	aggressive
O	defense
O	is
O	debilitating
O	for
O	Justin
O	.

O	It
O	's
O	also
O	costly
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Kaye
O	says
O	he
O	has
O	paid
O	more
O	than
O	$
O	70,000
O	in
O	legal
O	fees
O	so
O	far
O	.

O	Of

O	Well
O	before

O	,
O	though
O	,
O	there
O	were
O	signs
O	that
O	the
O	junk
O	market
O	was
O	stumbling
O	through
O	one
O	of
O	its
O	worst
O	years
O	ever
O	.

O	Despite
O	the
O	relatively
O	strong
O	economy
O	,
O	junk
O	bond
O	prices
O	did
O	nothing
O	except
O	go
O	down
O	,
O	hammered
O	by
O	a
O	seemingly
O	endless
O	trail
O	of
O	bad
O	news
O	:

O	--
O	In
O	June
O	,
O	two
O	months
O	before
O	it
O	would
O	default
O	on

O	payments
O	covering

O	1.2

O	of

O	debt
O	securities
O	,
O	New
O	York-based
O	Integrated
O	Resources
O	Inc.
O	said
O	it
O	ran
O	out
O	of
O	borrowed
O	money
O	.

O	--
O	In
O	July
O	,
O	Southmark
O	Corp.

O	--
O	By

O	,
O	the

O	between

O	500

O	.

O	--
O	In

O	,
O	just
O	as
O	the
O	cash
O	squeeze
O	hit
O	Campeau
O	,
O	Lomas
O	Financial

O	defaulted

O	1.2

O	of
O	debt
O	securities
O	.

O	Meantime
O	,
O	regulators
O	are
O	becoming
O	increasingly
O	worried
O	as
O	the
O	rush
O	to
O	leverage
O	shows
O	no
O	signs
O	of

O	.

O	Moody

O	is
O	the

O	this

O	In

O	,
O	there
O	are

O	Friday

O	Prices
O	of

O	surged
O	in
O	the

O	of

O	as

O	fled
O	a

O	Bond

O	barely
O	budged

O	Many

O	be

O	eying
O	the

O	Prices

O	Friday
O	's
O	190-point
O	plunge
O	in
O	stocks
O	does
O	not
O	come
O	atop
O	the
O	climate
O	of
O	anxiety
O	that
O	dominated
O	financial
O	markets
O	just
O	prior
O	to
O	their
O	1987
O	October
O	crash
O	,
O	and
O	mechanisms
O	have
O	been
O	put
O	in
O	place
O	to
O	keep
O	markets
O	more
O	orderly
O	.

O	Still
O	,
O	the
O	lesson
O	is
O	about
O	the
O	same
O	:
O	On
O	Friday
O	the
O	13th
O	,
O	the
O	market
O	was
O	spooked
O	by
O	Washington
O	.

O	The
O	consensus
O	along
O	the
O	street
O	seems
O	to
O	be
O	that
O	the
O	plunge
O	was
O	triggered
O	by
O	the
O	financing
O	problems
O	of
O	the
O	UAL
O	takeover
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	's
O	certainly
O	true
O	the
O	rout
O	began
O	immediately
O	after
O	the
O	UAL
O	trading
O	halt
O	.

O	Still
O	,
O	the
O	consensus
O	seems
O	almost
O	as
O	wide
O	that
O	one
O	faltering
O	bid
O	is
O	no
O	reason
O	to
O	write
O	down
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	all
O	U.S.
O	business
O	.

O	This
O	observation
O	leads
O	us
O	to
O	another
O	piece
O	of
O	news
O	moving
O	on
O	the
O	Dow
O	Jones
O	ticker
O	shortly
O	before
O	the
O	downturn
O	:
O	the
O	success
O	of
O	Senate
O	Democrats
O	in
O	stalling
O	the
O	capital
O	gains
O	tax
O	cut
O	.

O	The
O	real
O	value
O	of
O	all
O	shares
O	,
O	after
O	all
O	,
O	is
O	directly
O	impacted
O	by
O	the
O	tax
O	on
O	any
O	profits
O	-LRB-
O	all
O	the
O	more
O	so
O	given
O	the
O	limits
O	on
O	deductions
O	for
O	losses
O	that
O	show
O	gains
O	are
O	not
O	``
O	ordinary
O	income
O	''
O	-RRB-
O	.

O	And
O	market
O	expectations
O	clearly
O	have
O	been
O	raised
O	by
O	the
O	capital
O	gains
O	victory
O	in
O	the
O	House
O	last
O	month
O	.

O	An
O	hour
O	before
O	Friday
O	's
O	plunge
O	,
O	that
O	provision
O	was
O	stripped
O	from
O	the
O	tax
O	bill
O	,
O	leaving
O	it
O	with
O	$
O	5.4
O	billion
O	in
O	tax
O	increases
O	without
O	a
O	capital
O	gains
O	cut
O	.

O	There
O	is
O	a
O	great
O	deal
O	to
O	be
O	said
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	for
O	stripping
O	the
O	garbage
O	out
O	of
O	the
O	reconciliation
O	bill
O	.

O	It
O	would
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	thing
O	if
O	Congress
O	started
O	to
O	decide
O	issues
O	one-by-one
O	on
O	their
O	individual
O	merits
O	without
O	trickery
O	.

O	For
O	one
O	thing
O	,
O	no
O	one
O	doubts
O	that
O	the
O	capital
O	gains
O	cut
O	would
O	pass
O	on
O	an
O	up-or-down
O	vote
O	.

O	Since
O	Senate
O	leaders
O	have
O	so
O	far
O	fogged
O	it
O	up
O	with
O	procedural
O	smokescreens
O	,
O	promises
O	of
O	a
O	cleaner
O	bill
O	are
O	suspect
O	.

O	Especially
O	so
O	since
O	President
O	Bush
O	has
O	been
O	weakened
O	by
O	the
O	Panama
O	fiasco
O	.

O	To
O	the
O	extent
O	that
O	the
O	UAL
O	troubles
O	contributed
O	to
O	the
O	plunge
O	,
O	they
O	are
O	another
O	instance
O	of
O	Washington
O	's
O	sticky
O	fingers
O	.

O	As
O	the
O	best
O	opportunities
O	for
O	corporate
O	restructurings
O	are
O	exhausted
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	at
O	some
O	point
O	the
O	market
O	will
O	start
O	to
O	reject
O	them
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	airlines
O	are
O	scarcely
O	a
O	clear
O	case
O	,
O	given
O	anti-takeover
O	mischief
O	by
O	Secretary
O	of
O	Transportation
O	Skinner
O	,
O	who
O	professes
O	to
O	believe
O	safety
O	will
O	be
O	compromised
O	if
O	KLM
O	and
O	British
O	Airways
O	own
O	interests
O	in
O	companies
O	that
O	fly
O	airplanes
O	.

O	Worse
O	,
O	Congress
O	has
O	started
O	to
O	jump
O	on
O	the
O	Skinner
O	bandwagon
O	.

O	James
O	Oberstar
O	,
O	the
O	Minnesota
O	Democrat
O	who
O	chairs
O	the
O	Public
O	Works
O	and
O	Transportation
O	Committee
O	's
O	aviation
O	subcommittee
O	,
O	has
O	put
O	an
O	anti-airline
O	takeover
O	bill
O	on
O	supersonic
O	speed
O	so
O	that
O	it
O	would
O	be
O	passed
O	in
O	time
O	to
O	affect
O	the
O	American
O	and
O	United
O	Air
O	Lines
O	bids
O	.

O	It
O	would
O	give
O	Mr.
O	Skinner
O	up
O	to
O	50
O	days
O	to
O	``
O	review
O	''
O	any
O	bid
O	for
O	15
O	%
O	or
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	voting
O	stock
O	of
O	any
O	U.S.
O	carrier
O	with
O	revenues
O	of
O	$
O	1
O	billion
O	or
O	more
O	.

O	So
O	the
O	UAL
O	deal
O	has
O	problems
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	market
O	loses
O	190
O	points
O	.

O	Congratulations
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Secretary
O	and
O	Mr.
O	Congressman
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	1987
O	crash
O	,
O	remember
O	,
O	the
O	market
O	was
O	shaken
O	by
O	a
O	Danny
O	Rostenkowski
O	proposal
O	to
O	tax
O	takeovers
O	out
O	of
O	existance
O	.

O	Even
O	more
O	important
O	,
O	in
O	our
O	view
O	,
O	was
O	the
O	Treasury
O	's
O	threat
O	to
O	thrash
O	the
O	dollar
O	.

O	The
O	Treasury
O	is
O	doing
O	the
O	same
O	thing
O	today
O	;
O	thankfully
O	,
O	the
O	dollar
O	is
O	not
O	under
O	1987-style
O	pressure
O	.

O	Also
O	,
O	traders
O	are
O	in
O	better
O	shape
O	today
O	than
O	in
O	1987
O	to
O	survive
O	selling
O	binges
O	.

O	They
O	are
O	better
O	capitalized
O	.

O	They
O	are
O	in
O	less
O	danger
O	of
O	losing
O	liquidity
O	simply
O	because
O	of
O	tape
O	lags
O	and
O	clearing
O	and
O	settlement
O	delays
O	.

O	The
O	Fed
O	promises
O	any
O	needed
O	liquidity
O	.

O	The
O	Big
O	Board
O	's
O	liaison
O	with
O	the
O	Chicago
O	Board
O	of
O	Trade
O	has
O	improved
O	;
O	it
O	will
O	be
O	interesting
O	to
O	learn
O	if
O	``
O	circuit
O	breakers
O	''
O	prove
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	good
O	idea
O	.

O	In
O	any
O	event
O	,
O	some
O	traders
O	see
O	stocks
O	as
O	underpriced
O	today
O	,
O	unlike
O	1987
O	.

O	There
O	is
O	nothing
O	wrong
O	with
O	the
O	market
O	that
O	ca
O	n't
O	be
O	cured
O	by
O	a
O	little
O	coherence
O	and
O	common
O	sense
O	in
O	Washington
O	.

O	But
O	on
O	the
O	bearish
O	side
O	,
O	that
O	may
O	be
O	too
O	much
O	to
O	expect
O	.

O	Greece

O	bout
O	of
O	general
O	elections
O	this
O	year
O	is
O	slated
O	for

O	5
O	.

O	For
O	those
O	hoping
O	to
O	see
O	a
O	modicum
O	of
O	political
O	normalcy
O	restored
O	--
O	in
O	view
O	of
O	Greece
O	's
O	eight-year
O	misadventure
O	under
O	autocratic
O	pseudosocialism
O	and
O	subsequent
O	three-month
O	hitch
O	with
O	a
O	conservative-communist
O	coalition
O	government
O	--
O	there
O	is
O	but
O	one
O	bright
O	sign
O	:
O	The
O	scandals
O	still
O	encircling
O	former
O	Prime
O	Minister
O	Andreas
O	Papandreou
O	and
O	his
O	fallen
O	socialist
O	government
O	are
O	like
O	flies
O	buzzing
O	around
O	a
O	rotting
O	carcass
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	mid-June
O	round
O	of
O	voting
O	,
O	Greeks
O	gave
O	no
O	clear
O	mandate
O	to
O	any
O	single
O	political
O	party
O	.

O	The
O	ad
O	interim
O	coalition
O	government
O	that
O	emerged
O	from
O	post-electoral
O	hagglings
O	was
O	,
O	in
O	essence
O	,
O	little
O	more
O	than
O	the
O	ill-conceived
O	offspring
O	of
O	ideological
O	miscegenation
O	:
O	On
O	one
O	side
O	,
O	the
O	center-right
O	New
O	Democracy
O	Party
O	,
O	headed
O	by
O	Constantine
O	Mitsotakis
O	.

O	On
O	the
O	other
O	,
O	the
O	so-called
O	Coalition
O	of
O	the
O	Left
O	and
O	Progress
O	--
O	a
O	quaint
O	and
O	rather
O	deceptive
O	title
O	for
O	a
O	merger
O	of
O	the
O	pro-Soviet
O	Communist
O	Party
O	of
O	Greece
O	and
O	its
O	Euro-Communist
O	cousin
O	,
O	the
O	Hellenic
O	Left
O	.

O	The
O	unifying
O	bond
O	for
O	this
O	left-right
O	mismatch
O	was
O	plain
O	:
O	PASOK
O	-LRB-
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	's
O	party
O	-RRB-
O	as
O	common
O	political
O	enemy
O	.

O	The
O	ostensible
O	goal
O	was
O	a
O	mop-up
O	of
O	government
O	corruption
O	,
O	purportedly
O	at
O	all
O	levels
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	main
O	marks
O	were
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	and
O	his
O	closest
O	associates
O	.

O	In
O	point
O	of
O	fact
O	,
O	this
O	catharsis
O	was
O	overdue
O	by
O	decades
O	.

O	When
O	reduced
O	to
O	buzzword
O	status
O	in
O	ex
O	parte
O	pledges
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	notion
O	transmogrified
O	into
O	a
O	promised
O	assault
O	,
O	with
O	targets
O	primarily
O	for
O	political
O	gains
O	,
O	not
O	justice
O	.

O	With
O	regard
O	to
O	Greece
O	's
O	long-bubbling
O	bank-looting
O	scandal
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	's
O	principal
O	accuser
O	remains
O	George
O	Koskotas
O	,
O	former
O	owner
O	of
O	the
O	Bank
O	of
O	Crete
O	and
O	self-confessed
O	embezzler
O	,
O	now
O	residing
O	in
O	a
O	jail
O	cell
O	in
O	Salem
O	,
O	Mass.
O	,
O	from
O	where
O	he
O	is
O	fighting
O	extradition
O	proceedings
O	that
O	would
O	return
O	him
O	to
O	Greece
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Koskotas
O	's
O	credibility
O	is
O	,
O	at
O	best
O	,
O	problematic
O	.

O	He
O	has
O	ample
O	motive
O	to
O	shift
O	the
O	blame
O	,
O	and
O	his
O	testimony
O	has
O	also
O	been
O	found
O	less
O	than
O	forthright
O	on
O	numerous
O	points
O	.

O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	the
O	New
O	Democracy
O	and
O	Communist
O	parties
O	herald
O	his
O	assertions
O	as
O	proof
O	of
O	PASOK
O	complicity
O	.

O	Among
O	unanswered
O	questions
O	are
O	whether
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	received
O	$
O	23
O	million
O	of
O	stolen
O	Bank
O	of
O	Crete
O	funds
O	and
O	an
O	additional
O	$
O	734,000
O	in
O	bribes
O	,
O	as
O	contended
O	;
O	whether
O	the
O	prime
O	minister
O	ordered
O	state
O	agencies
O	to
O	deposit
O	some
O	$
O	57
O	million
O	in
O	Mr.
O	Koskotas
O	's
O	bank
O	and
O	then
O	skim
O	off
O	the
O	interest
O	;
O	and
O	,
O	what
O	PASOK
O	's
O	cut
O	was
O	from
O	the
O	$
O	210
O	million
O	Mr.
O	Koskotas
O	pinched
O	.

O	Two
O	former
O	ministers
O	were
O	so
O	heavily
O	implicated
O	in
O	the
O	Koskotas
O	affair
O	that
O	PASOK
O	members
O	of
O	Parliament
O	voted
O	to
O	refer
O	them
O	to
O	the
O	special
O	court
O	.

O	But
O	eluding
O	parliamentary
O	probe
O	was
O	the
O	case
O	of
O	millions
O	of
O	drachmas
O	Mr.
O	Koskotas
O	funneled
O	into
O	New
O	Democracy
O	coffers
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	end
O	,
O	the
O	investigation
O	produced
O	only
O	circumstantial
O	evidence
O	and
O	``
O	indications
O	''
O	that
O	point
O	to
O	PASOK
O	,
O	not
O	clinching
O	proof
O	.

O	On
O	another
O	issue
O	,
O	Greeks
O	were
O	told
O	how
O	their
O	national
O	intelligence
O	agency
O	,
O	the
O	EYP
O	,
O	regularly
O	monitored
O	the
O	telephone
O	conversations
O	of
O	prominent
O	figures
O	,
O	including
O	key
O	opposition
O	politicians
O	,
O	journalists
O	and
O	PASOK
O	cabinet
O	members
O	.

O	Despite
O	convincing
O	arguments
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	never
O	established
O	that
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	personally
O	ordered
O	or
O	directed
O	the
O	wiretaps
O	.

O	The
O	central
O	weakness
O	of
O	the
O	``
O	scandals
O	''
O	debates
O	was
O	pointed
O	up
O	especially
O	well
O	when
O	discussions
O	focused
O	on
O	arms
O	deals
O	and
O	kickbacks
O	.

O	The
O	coalition
O	government
O	tried
O	to
O	show
O	that
O	PASOK
O	ministers
O	had
O	received
O	hefty
O	sums
O	for
O	OKing
O	the
O	purchase
O	of
O	F-16
O	Fighting
O	Falcon
O	and
O	Mirage
O	2000
O	combat
O	aircraft
O	,
O	produced
O	by
O	the
O	U.S.based
O	General
O	Dynamics
O	Corp.
O	and
O	France
O	's
O	Avions
O	Marcel
O	Dassault
O	,
O	respectively
O	.

O	Naturally
O	,
O	neither
O	General
O	Dynamics
O	nor
O	Dassault
O	could
O	be
O	expected
O	to
O	hamper
O	its
O	prospective
O	future
O	dealings
O	by
O	making
O	disclosures
O	of
O	sums
O	paid
O	-LRB-
O	or
O	not
O	-RRB-
O	to
O	various
O	Greek
O	officials
O	for
O	services
O	rendered
O	.

O	So
O	it
O	seems
O	that
O	Mr.
O	Mitsotakis
O	and
O	his
O	communist
O	chums
O	may
O	have
O	unwittingly
O	served
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	a
O	moral
O	victory
O	on
O	a
O	platter
O	:
O	PASOK
O	,
O	whether
O	guilty
O	or
O	not
O	,
O	can
O	now
O	traipse
O	the
O	countryside
O	condemning
O	the
O	whole
O	affair
O	as
O	a
O	witch
O	hunt
O	at
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	's
O	expense
O	.

O	But
O	while
O	verbal
O	high
O	jinks
O	alone
O	wo
O	n't
O	help
O	PASOK
O	regain
O	power
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	should
O	never
O	be
O	underestimated
O	.

O	First
O	came
O	his
O	predictable
O	fusillade
O	:
O	He
O	charged
O	the
O	Coalition
O	of
O	the
O	Left
O	and
O	Progress
O	had
O	sold
O	out
O	its
O	leftist
O	tenets
O	by
O	collaborating
O	in
O	a
O	right-wing
O	plot
O	aimed
O	at
O	ousting
O	PASOK
O	and
O	thwarting
O	the
O	course
O	of
O	socialism
O	in
O	Greece
O	.

O	Then
O	,
O	to
O	buttress
O	his
O	credibility
O	with
O	the
O	left
O	,
O	he
O	enticed
O	some
O	smaller
O	leftist
O	parties
O	to
O	stand
O	for
O	election
O	under
O	the
O	PASOK
O	banner
O	.

O	Next
O	,
O	he
O	continued
O	to
O	court
O	the
O	communists
O	--
O	many
O	of
O	whom
O	feel
O	betrayed
O	by
O	the
O	left-right
O	coalition
O	's
O	birth
O	--
O	by
O	bringing
O	into
O	PASOK
O	a
O	well-respected
O	Communist
O	Party
O	candidate
O	.

O	For
O	balance
O	,
O	and
O	in
O	hopes
O	of
O	gaining
O	some
O	disaffected
O	centrist
O	votes
O	,
O	he
O	managed
O	to
O	attract
O	a
O	former
O	New
O	Democracy
O	Party
O	representative
O	and
O	known
O	political
O	enemy
O	of
O	Mr.
O	Mitsotakis
O	.

O	Thus
O	PASOK
O	heads
O	for
O	the
O	polls
O	not
O	only
O	with
O	diminished
O	scandal-stench
O	,
O	but
O	also
O	with
O	``
O	seals
O	of
O	approval
O	''
O	from
O	representatives
O	of
O	its
O	harshest
O	accusers
O	.

O	Crucial
O	as
O	these
O	elections
O	are
O	for
O	Greece
O	,
O	pressing
O	issues
O	of
O	state
O	are
O	getting
O	lost
O	in
O	the
O	shuffle
O	.

O	The
O	country
O	's
O	future
O	NATO
O	participation
O	remains
O	unsure
O	,
O	for
O	instance
O	.

O	Greece
O	also
O	must
O	revamp
O	major
O	pieces
O	of
O	legislation
O	in
O	preparation
O	for
O	the
O	1992
O	targets
O	of
O	heightened
O	Common
O	Market
O	cooperation
O	.

O	Greece
O	's
O	bilateral
O	relations
O	with
O	the
O	U.S.
O	need
O	attention
O	soon
O	as
O	well
O	.

O	For
O	one
O	,
O	the
O	current
O	accord
O	concerning
O	U.S.
O	military
O	bases
O	in
O	Greece
O	lapses
O	in
O	May
O	1990
O	.

O	Negotiations
O	for
O	a
O	new
O	agreement
O	were
O	frozen
O	before
O	the
O	June
O	elections
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	clock
O	is
O	running
O	.

O	Another
O	matter
O	of
O	concern
O	is
O	the
O	extradition
O	of
O	Mohammed
O	Rashid
O	,
O	a
O	Palestinian
O	terrorist
O	who
O	is
O	wanted
O	in
O	the
O	U.S.
O	for
O	the
O	1982
O	bombing
O	of
O	a
O	Pan
O	American
O	Airways
O	flight
O	.

O	The
O	Greek
O	courts
O	have
O	decided
O	in
O	favor
O	of
O	extradition
O	in
O	the
O	Rashid
O	case
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	matter
O	awaits
O	final
O	approval
O	from
O	Greece
O	's
O	next
O	justice
O	minister
O	.

O	The
O	Greeks
O	seem
O	barely
O	aware
O	of
O	the
O	importance
O	of
O	the
O	case
O	as
O	a
O	litmus
O	test
O	of
O	whether
O	Greece
O	will
O	be
O	counted
O	in
O	or
O	out
O	for
O	international
O	efforts
O	to
O	combat
O	terrorism
O	.

O	That
O	PASOK
O	could
O	win
O	the
O	elections
O	outright
O	is
O	improbable
O	;
O	the
O	Greek
O	press
O	,
O	previously
O	eager
O	to
O	palm
O	off
O	PASOK
O	's
O	line
O	,
O	has
O	turned
O	on
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	with
O	a
O	wild-eyed
O	vengeance
O	.

O	Yet
O	the
O	possibility
O	of
O	another
O	lash-up
O	government
O	is
O	all
O	too
O	real
O	.

O	If
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	becomes
O	the
O	major
O	opposition
O	leader
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	hamstring
O	a
O	conservative-led
O	coalition
O	.

O	Also
O	,
O	he
O	could
O	force
O	new
O	elections
O	early
O	next
O	year
O	by
O	frustrating
O	the
O	procedures
O	for
O	the
O	election
O	of
O	the
O	president
O	of
O	the
O	republic
O	in
O	March
O	.

O	New
O	Democracy
O	has
O	once
O	again
O	glaringly
O	underestimated
O	the
O	opponent
O	and
O	linked
O	its
O	own
O	prospects
O	to
O	negative
O	reaction
O	against
O	PASOK
O	,
O	forgetting
O	to
O	tend
O	to
O	either
O	program
O	clarity
O	or
O	the
O	rectification
O	of
O	internal
O	squabbles
O	.

O	As
O	for
O	Mr.
O	Papandreou
O	?

O	He
O	's
O	not
O	exactly
O	sitting
O	pretty
O	at
O	this
O	stage
O	.

O	But
O	since
O	he
O	is
O	undoubtedly
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	proficient
O	bull
O	slingers
O	who
O	ever
O	raked
O	muck
O	,
O	it
O	seems
O	far
O	wiser
O	to
O	view
O	him
O	as
O	sidelined
O	,
O	but
O	certainly
O	not
O	yet
O	eliminated
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Carpenter
O	,
O	a
O	regional
O	correspondent
O	for
O	National
O	Review
O	,
O	has
O	lived
O	in
O	Athens
O	since
O	1981
O	.


O	U.S.
O	OFFICIALS
O	MOVED
O	to
O	head
O	off
O	any
O	repeat
O	of
O	Black
O	Monday
O	today
O	following
O	Friday
O	's
O	plunge
O	in
O	stock
O	prices
O	.

O	Fed
O	Chairman
O	Greenspan
O	signaled
O	that
O	the
O	central
O	bank
O	was
O	prepared
O	to
O	inject
O	massive
O	amounts
O	of
O	money
O	into
O	the
O	banking
O	system
O	to
O	prevent
O	a
O	financial
O	crisis
O	.

O	Other
O	U.S.
O	and
O	foreign
O	officials
O	also
O	mapped
O	out
O	plans
O	,
O	though
O	they
O	kept
O	their
O	moves
O	quiet
O	to
O	avoid
O	making
O	the
O	financial
O	markets
O	more
O	jittery
O	.

O	Friday
O	's
O	sell-off
O	was
O	triggered
O	by
O	the
O	collapse
O	of
O	UAL
O	's
O	buy-out
O	plan
O	and
O	a
O	big
O	rise
O	in
O	producer
O	prices
O	.

O	The
O	Dow
O	Jones
O	industrials
O	skidded
O	190.58
O	,
O	to
O	2569.26
O	.

O	A

O	liable
O	for

O	concurrently
O	revealed
O	substantial
O	information
O	about
O	the
O	product
O	's
O	flaws
O	.

O	The
O	ruling
O	stems
O	from
O	a
O	1984
O	suit
O	filed
O	by
O	shareholders
O	of
O	Apple
O	Computer
O	Inc.
O	,
O	claiming
O	that
O	company
O	officials
O	misled
O	investors
O	about
O	the
O	expected
O	success
O	of
O	the
O	Lisa
O	computer
O	,
O	introduced
O	in
O	1983
O	.

O	Lawyers
O	specializing
O	in
O	shareholder
O	suits
O	said
O	they
O	are
O	concerned
O	that
O	use
O	of
O	the
O	``
O	press
O	defense
O	''
O	by
O	corporations
O	may
O	become
O	popular
O	as
O	a
O	result
O	of
O	the
O	ruling
O	.

O	According
O	to
O	the
O	suit
O	,
O	Apple
O	officials
O	created
O	public
O	excitement
O	by
O	touting
O	Lisa
O	as
O	an
O	office
O	computer
O	that
O	would
O	revolutionize
O	the
O	workplace
O	and
O	be
O	extremely
O	successful
O	in
O	its
O	first
O	year
O	.

O	The
O	plaintiffs
O	also
O	alleged
O	that
O	prior
O	to
O	the
O	fanfare
O	,
O	the
O	company
O	circulated
O	internal
O	memos
O	indicating
O	problems
O	with
O	Lisa
O	.

O	The
O	suit
O	claimed
O	Apple
O	's
O	stock
O	climbed
O	to
O	a
O	high
O	of
O	$
O	63.50
O	a
O	share
O	on
O	the
O	basis
O	of
O	the
O	company
O	's
O	optimistic
O	forecasts
O	.

O	But
O	when
O	the
O	company
O	revealed
O	Lisa
O	's
O	poor
O	sales
O	late
O	in
O	1983
O	,
O	the
O	stock
O	plummeted
O	to
O	a
O	low
O	of
O	$
O	17.37
O	a
O	share
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	the
O	suit
O	.

O	The
O	shareholders
O	claimed
O	more
O	than
O	$
O	150
O	million
O	in
O	losses
O	.

O	In
O	1987
O	,
O	the
O	San
O	Francisco
O	district
O	court
O	dismissed
O	the
O	case
O	largely
O	because
O	newspaper
O	reports
O	had
O	sufficiently
O	counterbalanced
O	the
O	company
O	's
O	statements
O	by
O	alerting
O	consumers
O	to
O	Lisa
O	's
O	problems
O	.

O	Late
O	last
O	month
O	,
O	the
O	appeals
O	court
O	agreed
O	that
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	case
O	should
O	be
O	dismissed
O	.

O	However
O	,
O	it
O	gave
O	the
O	shareholders
O	the
O	right
O	to
O	pursue
O	a
O	small
O	portion
O	of
O	their
O	claim
O	that
O	pertains
O	to
O	Lisa
O	's
O	disk
O	drive
O	,
O	known
O	as
O	Twiggy
O	.

O	The
O	court
O	ruled
O	that
O	the
O	news
O	media
O	did
O	n't
O	reveal
O	Twiggy
O	's
O	problems
O	at
O	the
O	time
O	.

O	Lawyers
O	are
O	worried
O	about
O	the
O	ruling
O	's
O	implication
O	in
O	other
O	shareholder
O	suits
O	but
O	pointed
O	out
O	that
O	the
O	court
O	stressed
O	that
O	the
O	ruling
O	should
O	be
O	regarded
O	as
O	very
O	specific
O	to
O	the
O	Apple
O	case
O	.

O	A
O	four-page
O	ad
O	from
O	Texas
O	Instruments
O	Inc.
O	,
O	running
O	in

O	,
O	contains
O	a
O	speech
O	synthesizer
O	laminated
O	between
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	pages
O	.

O	Readers
O	who
O	pull
O	off
O	a
O	piece
O	of
O	tape
O	and
O	press
O	a
O	switch
O	will
O	hear
O	a
O	tiny
O	--
O	but
O	distinctly
O	human-sounding
O	--
O	voice
O	announce
O	,
O	``

O	as

O	on

O	.

O	The
O	talking
O	chip
O	is
O	n't
O	cheap
O	--
O	the
O	per-ad
O	cost
O	to
O	Texas

O	is
O	about

O	4
O	,
O	and
O	that

O	without

O	Week
O	's

O	--
O	but
O	Texas
O	Instruments
O	believes
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	first
O	.

O	Previous
O	efforts
O	have
O	included
O	musical
O	ads
O	,
O	featuring
O	simple
O	tone-generating
O	chips
O	that
O	play
O	a
O	tune
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	voice
O	synthesizer
O	in
O	this
O	effort
O	is
O	much
O	more
O	sophisticated
O	,
O	with
O	none
O	of
O	the
O	robotic
O	flatness
O	that
O	one
O	hears
O	,
O	for
O	example
O	,
O	when
O	calling
O	telephone
O	directory
O	services
O	.

O	And
O	for
O	those
O	who
O	miss
O	the
O	message
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	around
O	,
O	not
O	to
O	worry
O	:
O	Three
O	tiny
O	batteries
O	provide
O	enough
O	juice
O	for

O	many
O	as
O	650
O	replays

O	Lomas
O	Financial
O	Corp.
O	,
O	Dallas
O	,
O	said
O	it
O	will
O	ask
O	a
O	U.S.
O	bankruptcy
O	court
O	to
O	allow
O	it
O	to
O	hire

O	to

O	Equitable
O	Lomas
O	Leasing

O	for
O	several

O	,
O	apparently
O	without
O	success
O	.

O	The
O	real
O	estate
O	and
O	mortgage
O	banking
O	concern
O	had
O	hoped
O	to
O	use
O	proceeds
O	from
O	the
O	sale
O	to
O	reduce
O	its
O	debt
O	.

O	Without
O	cash
O	from

O	sales
O	and
O	unable
O	to
O	reach
O	a
O	new
O	bank-credit
O	agreement
O	,
O	Lomas
O	defaulted
O	on
O	$
O	145

O	.

O	It

O	under

O	of

O	Sept.

O	to

O	its

O	1.45

O	Lomas
O	said
O	Merrill
O	Lynch
O	,
O	which
O	owns

O	and

O	in
O	Lomas
O	,
O	could
O	n't

O	because
O	it
O	is
O	also
O	a
O	creditor
O	.

O	It
O	said
O	it
O	chose
O	Lazard
O	in
O	part
O	because
O	of
O	Lazard
O	's
O	offices
O	in
O	Europe
O	and
O	Japan
O	,
O	where

O	might
O	be

O	company
O	.


O	Canadian

O	cover
O	all
O	its

O	to

O	Don

O	,

O	president
O	and
O	chief
O	accountant
O	,
O	said
O	the
O	bank
O	's
O	strong
O	earnings
O	enable
O	it
O	to

O	the

O	Canadian

O	to

O	he

O	The

O	525

O	will
O	be
O	added
O	to

O	in
O	its
O	fourth
O	quarter
O	,
O	ending
O	Oct.

O	.

O	Mr.
O	Bowder
O	said
O	the
O	C$
O	300
O	million
O	charge
O	to
O	earnings
O	would
O	amount
O	to
O	about
O	C$

O	,
O	or
O	C$
O	3.10

O	.

O	Mr.

O	said
O	the

O	will
O	restructure
O	its
O	C$
O	604
O	million
O	of
O	Mexican
O	debt
O	,
O	of
O	which
O	C$
O	255
O	million
O	is
O	in
O	Mexican
O	notes
O	secured
O	by
O	U.S.
O	government
O	bonds
O	.

O	The

O	has
O	a

O	%
O	reserve
O	against
O	the
O	remaining
O	C$
O	349

O	of

O	and
O	expects

O	that
O	for
O	other
O	Mexican
O	notes
O	supported
O	by
O	U.S.
O	Treasury
O	zero-coupon
O	bonds
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Bowder
O	said
O	the
O	bank
O	's
O	experience
O	with
O	LDC
O	debt
O	has
O	been
O	``
O	painful
O	''
O	and
O	this
O	latest
O	move
O	represents
O	the
O	final
O	phase
O	of
O	a
O	program
O	begun
O	seven
O	years
O	ago
O	to
O	reduce
O	its
O	exposure
O	through
O	provisioning
O	,
O	debt
O	sales
O	and
O	debt
O	swaps
O	.

O	He
O	said
O	the
O	bank
O	will
O	no
O	longer
O	participate
O	in
O	LDC
O	sovereign
O	lending
O	,
O	but
O	will

O	that

O	the

O	's
O	standards
O	.


O	The
O	carnage
O	among
O	takeover
O	stocks
O	Friday
O	does
O	n't
O	mean
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	mega-mergers
O	but
O	simply
O	marks
O	the
O	start
O	of
O	a
O	less
O	ambitious
O	game
O	,
O	Wall
O	Street
O	's
O	big-time
O	deal
O	makers
O	say
O	.

O	Suitors
O	from
O	now
O	on
O	are
O	more
O	likely
O	to
O	be
O	expansion-minded
O	companies
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	raiders
O	or
O	debt-happy
O	financiers
O	.

O	And
O	they
O	will
O	be
O	launching
O	lower-priced
O	and
O	perhaps
O	fewer
O	deals
O	,
O	now
O	that
O	it
O	's
O	tougher
O	to
O	finance
O	them
O	.

O	This
O	is
O	an
O	ominous
O	sign
O	for
O	a
O	stock
O	market
O	that
O	lately
O	has
O	been
O	fueled

O	For

O	,
O	the

O	significance
O	of
O	the
O	Vitro-Anchor
O	deal
O	may
O	be
O	that

O	late

O	would
O	be
O	hurt
O	if
O	the
O	troubles
O	of
O	the

O	group
O	signified
O	a

O	Of
O	all
O	the
O	one-time
O	expenses
O	incurred
O	by
O	a
O	corporation
O	or
O	professional
O	firm
O	,
O	few
O	are
O	larger
O	or
O	longer
O	term
O	than
O	the
O	purchase
O	of
O	real
O	estate
O	or
O	the
O	signing
O	of
O	a
O	commercial
O	lease
O	.

O	To
O	take
O	full
O	advantage
O	of
O	the
O	financial
O	opportunities
O	in
O	this
O	commitment
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	corporation
O	or
O	professional
O	firm
O	must
O	do
O	more
O	than
O	negotiate
O	the
O	best
O	purchase
O	price
O	or
O	lease
O	terms
O	.

O	It
O	must
O	also
O	evaluate
O	the
O	real-estate
O	market
O	in
O	the
O	chosen
O	location
O	from
O	a
O	new
O	perspective
O	.

O	Specifically
O	,
O	it
O	must
O	understand
O	how
O	real-estate
O	markets
O	overreact
O	to
O	shifts
O	in
O	regional
O	economies
O	and
O	then
O	take
O	advantage
O	of
O	these
O	opportunities
O	.

O	When
O	a
O	regional
O	economy
O	catches
O	cold
O	,
O	the
O	local
O	real-estate
O	market
O	gets
O	pneumonia
O	.

O	In
O	other
O	words
O	,
O	real-estate
O	market
O	indicators
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	building
O	permits
O	and
O	leasing
O	activity
O	,
O	plummet
O	much
O	further
O	than
O	a
O	local
O	economy
O	in
O	recession
O	.

O	This
O	was
O	seen
O	in
O	the
O	late
O	1960s
O	in
O	Los
O	Angeles
O	and
O	the
O	mid-1970s
O	in
O	New
O	York
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	reverse
O	is
O	also
O	true
O	:
O	When
O	a
O	region
O	's
O	economy
O	rebounds
O	from
O	a
O	slowdown
O	,
O	these
O	real-estate
O	indicators
O	will
O	rebound
O	far
O	faster
O	than
O	the
O	improving
O	economy
O	.

O	Why
O	do
O	local
O	real-estate
O	markets
O	overreact
O	to
O	regional
O	economic
O	cycles
O	?

O	Because
O	real-estate
O	purchases
O	and
O	leases
O	are
O	such
O	major
O	long-term
O	commitments
O	that
O	most
O	companies
O	and
O	individuals
O	make
O	these
O	decisions
O	only
O	when
O	confident
O	of
O	future
O	economic
O	stability
O	and
O	growth
O	.

O	Metropolitan
O	Detroit
O	was
O	written
O	off
O	economically
O	during
O	the
O	early
O	1980s
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	domestic
O	auto
O	industry
O	suffered
O	a
O	serious
O	sales
O	depression
O	and
O	adjustment
O	.

O	Area
O	employment
O	dropped
O	by
O	13
O	%
O	from
O	its
O	1979
O	peak
O	and
O	retail
O	sales
O	were
O	down
O	14
O	%
O	.

O	However
O	,
O	the
O	real-estate
O	market
O	was
O	hurt
O	even
O	more
O	.

O	For
O	example
O	,
O	residential
O	building
O	permits
O	in
O	the
O	trough
O	year
O	of
O	1982
O	were
O	off
O	76
O	%
O	from
O	the
O	1979
O	peak
O	level
O	.

O	Once
O	metropolitan
O	Detroit
O	's
O	economy
O	rallied
O	in
O	the
O	mid-1980s
O	,
O	real
O	estate
O	rebounded
O	.

O	Building
O	permits
O	,
O	for
O	example
O	,
O	soared
O	a

O	400
O	%
O	between
O	1982
O	and

O	peak
O	year
O	of
O	1986
O	.

O	Where
O	,
O	savvy
O	corporations
O	and
O	professional
O	firms
O	are
O	now
O	asking
O	,
O	are
O	today
O	's
O	opportunities
O	?

O	Look
O	no
O	further
O	than
O	metropolitan
O	Houston
O	and
O	Denver
O	,
O	two
O	of
O	the
O	most
O	depressed
O	,
O	overbuilt
O	and
O	potentially
O	undervalued
O	real-estate
O	markets
O	in
O	the
O	nation
O	.

O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	some
O	observers
O	have
O	touted
O	Houston
O	and
O	Denver
O	for
O	the
O	past
O	five
O	years
O	as
O	a
O	counter-cyclical
O	play
O	.

O	But
O	now
O	appears
O	to
O	be
O	the
O	time
O	to
O	act
O	.

O	Metropolitan
O	Houston
O	's
O	economy
O	did
O	drop
O	and
O	then
O	flatten
O	in
O	the
O	years
O	after
O	its
O	1982
O	peak
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	mid-1980s
O	,
O	employment
O	was
O	down
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	5
O	%
O	from
O	the
O	1982
O	peak
O	and
O	retail
O	sales
O	were
O	off
O	13
O	%
O	.

O	The
O	real-estate
O	market
O	suffered
O	even
O	more
O	severe
O	setbacks
O	.

O	Office
O	construction
O	dropped
O	97
O	%
O	.

O	The
O	vacancy
O	rate
O	soared
O	more
O	than
O	20
O	%
O	in
O	nearly
O	every
O	product
O	category
O	,
O	and
O	more
O	than
O	30
O	%
O	of
O	office
O	space
O	was
O	vacant
O	.

O	To
O	some
O	observers
O	,
O	the
O	empty
O	office
O	buildings
O	of
O	Houston
O	's
O	``
O	see-through
O	skyline
O	''
O	were
O	indicative
O	of
O	a
O	very
O	troubled
O	economy
O	.

O	As
O	usual
O	,
O	the
O	real-estate
O	market
O	had
O	overreacted
O	.

O	Actually
O	,
O	the
O	region
O	's
O	economy
O	retained
O	a
O	firm
O	foundation
O	.

O	Metropolitan
O	Houston
O	's
O	population
O	has
O	held
O	steady
O	over
O	the
O	past
O	six
O	years
O	.

O	And
O	personal
O	income
O	,
O	after
O	slumping
O	in
O	the
O	mid-1980s
O	,
O	has
O	returned
O	to
O	its
O	1982
O	level
O	in
O	real
O	dollar
O	terms
O	.

O	Today
O	,
O	metropolitan
O	Houston
O	's
O	real-estate
O	market
O	is
O	poised
O	for
O	a
O	significant
O	turnaround
O	.

O	More
O	than
O	42,000
O	jobs
O	were
O	added
O	in
O	metro
O	Houston
O	last
O	year
O	,
O	primarily
O	in
O	biotechnology
O	,
O	petrochemical
O	processing
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	computer
O	industry
O	.

O	This
O	growth
O	puts
O	Houston
O	in
O	the
O	top
O	five
O	metro
O	areas
O	in
O	the
O	nation
O	last
O	year
O	.

O	And
O	forecasts
O	project
O	a
O	2.5
O	%
O	to
O	3
O	%
O	growth
O	rate
O	in
O	jobs
O	over
O	the
O	next
O	few
O	years
O	--
O	nearly
O	twice
O	the
O	national
O	average
O	.

O	Denver
O	is
O	another
O	metropolitan
O	area
O	where
O	the
O	commercial
O	real-estate
O	market
O	has
O	overreacted
O	to
O	the
O	region
O	's
O	economic
O	trends
O	,
O	although
O	Denver
O	has
O	not
O	experienced
O	as
O	severe
O	an
O	economic
O	downturn
O	as
O	Houston
O	.

O	By
O	some
O	measures
O	,
O	metropolitan
O	Denver
O	's
O	economy
O	has
O	actually
O	improved
O	in
O	the
O	past
O	four
O	years
O	.

O	Its
O	population
O	has
O	continued
O	to
O	increase
O	since
O	1983
O	,
O	the
O	peak
O	year
O	of
O	the
O	economic
O	cycle
O	.

O	Employment
O	is
O	now
O	4
O	%
O	higher
O	than
O	in
O	1983
O	.

O	Buying
O	income
O	in
O	real
O	dollars
O	actually
O	increased
O	15
O	%
O	between
O	1983
O	and
O	1987
O	-LRB-
O	the
O	most
O	recent
O	year
O	available
O	-RRB-
O	.

O	The
O	rates
O	of
O	increase
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	are
O	less
O	than
O	the
O	rapid
O	growth
O	of
O	the
O	boom
O	years
O	,
O	and
O	this
O	has
O	resulted
O	in
O	a
O	loss
O	of
O	confidence
O	in
O	the
O	economy
O	.

O	In
O	a
O	self-fulfilling
O	prophecy
O	,
O	therefore
O	,
O	the
O	region
O	's
O	real-estate
O	market
O	all
O	but
O	collapsed
O	in
O	recent
O	years
O	.

O	Housing
O	building
O	permits
O	are
O	down
O	more
O	than
O	75
O	%
O	from
O	their
O	1983
O	peaks
O	.

O	Although
O	no
O	one
O	can
O	predict
O	when
O	metropolitan
O	Denver
O	's
O	real-estate
O	market
O	will
O	rebound
O	,
O	major
O	public
O	works
O	projects
O	costing
O	several
O	billion
O	dollars
O	are
O	under
O	way
O	or
O	planned
O	--
O	such
O	as
O	a
O	new
O	convention
O	center
O	,
O	a
O	major
O	beltway
O	encircling
O	the
O	metropolitan
O	area
O	,
O	and
O	a
O	new
O	regional
O	airport
O	.

O	When
O	Denver
O	's
O	regional
O	economy
O	begins
O	to
O	grow
O	faster
O	--
O	such
O	a
O	recovery
O	could
O	occur
O	as
O	early
O	as
O	next
O	year
O	--
O	business
O	and
O	consumer
O	confidence
O	will
O	return
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	resulting
O	explosion
O	of
O	real-estate
O	activity
O	will
O	dwarf
O	the
O	general
O	economic
O	rebound
O	.

O	What
O	real-estate
O	strategy
O	should
O	one
O	follow
O	in
O	a
O	metropolitan
O	area
O	whose
O	economic
O	health
O	is
O	not
O	as
O	easy
O	to
O	determine
O	as
O	Houston
O	's
O	or
O	Denver
O	's
O	?

O	Generally
O	,
O	overcapacity
O	in
O	commercial
O	real
O	estate
O	is
O	dropping
O	from
O	its
O	mid-1980s
O	peak
O	,
O	even
O	in
O	such
O	economically
O	healthy
O	metropolitan
O	areas
O	as
O	Washington
O	,
O	New
O	York
O	and
O	Los
O	Angeles
O	.

O	Vacancy
O	rates
O	in
O	the
O	15
O	%
O	to
O	19
O	%
O	range
O	today
O	may
O	easily
O	rise
O	to
O	the
O	low
O	to
O	mid-20
O	%
O	range
O	in
O	a
O	couple
O	of
O	years
O	.

O	Under
O	these
O	conditions
O	,
O	even
O	a
O	flattening
O	out
O	of
O	economic
O	growth
O	--
O	``
O	catching
O	cold
O	''
O	--
O	in
O	the
O	healthy
O	metropolitan
O	areas
O	will
O	create
O	significant
O	opportunities
O	for
O	corporations
O	and
O	professional
O	service
O	firms
O	looking
O	for
O	bargains
O	as
O	the
O	realestate
O	industry
O	catches
O	pneumonia
O	.

O	Those
O	looking
O	for
O	real-estate
O	bargains
O	in
O	distressed
O	metropolitan
O	areas
O	should
O	lock
O	in

O	concern

O	Court
O	to
O	give
O	states
O	more

O	,

O	Solicitor

O	argued
O	that
O	the
O	1973
O	Supreme
O	Court
O	decision
O	,
O	Roe
O	vs.
O	Wade
O	,
O	recognizing
O	a
O	constitutional
O	right
O	to

O	,
O	was
O	incorrect
O	.

O	He
O	also
O	argued
O	that
O	the
O	high
O	court
O	was
O	wrong
O	in
O	1976
O	to
O	rule
O	that

O	have
O	a
O	right
O	to
O	abortion
O	that
O	ca
O	n't
O	be
O	absolutely
O	vetoed
O	by
O	their
O	parents
O	.

O	The
O	administration
O	's
O	position
O	was
O	outlined
O	in
O	a
O	friend-of-the-court
O	brief
O	filed
O	in
O	one
O	of
O	three
O	abortion
O	cases
O	the
O	Supreme
O	Court
O	will
O	hear
O	argued
O	and
O	will
O	decide
O	this
O	term
O	.

O	The
O	administration
O	filed
O	the
O	brief
O	in
O	an
O	appeal
O	involving
O	a
O	Minnesota
O	law
O	that
O	requires
O	that
O	both
O	parents
O	of
O	a
O	minor
O	be
O	notified
O	before
O	she
O	may
O	have
O	an
O	abortion
O	.

O	The
O	administration
O	urged
O	the
O	justices
O	to
O	adopt
O	a
O	legal
O	standard
O	suggested
O	by
O	Chief
O	Justice
O	William
O	Rehnquist
O	last
O	July
O	when
O	the
O	high
O	court
O	upheld
O	Missouri
O	's
O	abortion
O	restrictions
O	.

O	Under
O	that
O	standard
O	,
O	which
O	garnered
O	the
O	votes
O	of
O	only
O	three
O	of
O	the
O	nine
O	justices
O	,
O	a
O	state
O	restriction
O	of
O	abortion
O	is
O	constitutional
O	if
O	the
O	state
O	has
O	a
O	``
O	reasonable
O	''
O	justification
O	for
O	adopting
O	it
O	.

O	That
O	is
O	a
O	much
O	easier
O	standard
O	for
O	a
O	state
O	to
O	satisfy
O	than
O	the
O	Supreme
O	Court
O	's
O	test
O	since
O	1973
O	,
O	which
O	requires
O	a
O	state
O	to
O	have
O	a
O	``
O	compelling
O	''
O	reason
O	for
O	restricting
O	abortion
O	.

O	On
O	the
O	provisions
O	of
O	the
O	Minnesota
O	law
O	,
O	the
O	Bush
O	administration
O	said
O	that
O	requiring
O	that
O	both
O	parents
O	be
O	notified
O	is
O	a
O	reasonable
O	regulation
O	,
O	and
O	that
O	there
O	is
O	no
O	need
O	to
O	have
O	an
O	alternative
O	that
O	allows
O	minors
O	to
O	go

O	for
O	a

O	's

O	instead

O	The
O	Big
O	Three
O	's
O	drumbeat
O	for
O	deregulation
O	began
O	intensifying
O	in
O	the
O	summer
O	when
O	the
O	former
O	Time
O	Inc.
O	went
O	ahead
O	with
O	plans
O	to
O	acquire
O	Warner
O	.

O	Although
O	Time
O	already
O	had
O	a
O	long-term
O	contract
O	to
O	buy
O	movies
O	from
O	Warner
O	,
O	the

O	a
O	vertical

O	that
O	is
O	effectively
O	blocked

O	NBC
O	's
O	Mr.

O	led
O	the

O	in
O	decrying
O	the
O	networks
O	'
O	inability
O	to
O	match
O	a
O	Time-Warner
O	combination
O	.

O	He
O	spoke
O	up
O	again
O	when
O	the
O	Sony
O	bid
O	for
O	Columbia
O	was
O	announced
O	.

O	Since
O	NBC
O	's
O	interest
O	in
O	the

O	bid
O	for

O	With

O	NBC
O	would
O	move
O	into

O	says
O	William
O	Lilley
O	III
O	,
O	who
O	as
O	a
O	top
O	CBS
O	executive
O	spent
O	years
O	lobbying
O	to
O	have
O	the
O	rules
O	lifted
O	.

O	He
O	now
O	runs
O	Policy
O	Communications
O	in
O	Washington
O	,
O	consulting
O	to
O	media
O	companies
O	.

O	Fin-syn
O	rules
O	do
O	n't
O	explicitly
O	block
O	a
O	network
O	from
O	buying
O	a
O	passive
O	,
O	small
O	stake
O	in
O	a
O	company
O	that
O	profits
O	from
O	the
O	rerun
O	syndication
O	networks
O	ca
O	n't
O	enjoy
O	.

O	Hence
O	,
O	NBC
O	might
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	take
O	,
O	say
O	,
O	a
O	5
O	%
O	stake
O	in
O	a
O	company
O	such
O	as
O	MGM\/UA
O	.

O	If
O	the
O	transaction
O	raised
O	objections
O	,
O	the
O	studio
O	's
O	syndication
O	operations
O	could
O	be
O	spun
O	off
O	into
O	a
O	separate
O	firm
O	in
O	which
O	the
O	network
O	does
O	n't
O	have
O	a
O	direct
O	stake
O	.

O	But
O	such
O	convolutions
O	would
O	still
O	block
O	the
O	networks
O	from
O	grabbing
O	a
O	big
O	chunk
O	of
O	the
O	riches
O	of
O	syndication
O	.

O	Under
O	current
O	rules
O	,
O	even
O	when

O	Instead

O	will

O	The

O	admit
O	that
O	the
O	chances
O	of

O	President
O	F.W.
O	de
O	Klerk
O	released

O	ANC
O	men
O	--
O	along
O	with
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	founding
O	members
O	of
O	the
O	Pan
O	Africanist
O	Congress
O	,
O	a
O	rival
O	liberation
O	group
O	--
O	as
O	part
O	of
O	his
O	efforts
O	to
O	create
O	a
O	climate
O	of
O	trust
O	and
O	peace
O	in
O	which
O	his
O	government
O	can
O	begin
O	negotiations
O	with
O	black
O	leaders
O	over
O	a
O	new
O	constitution
O	aimed
O	at
O	giving
O	blacks
O	a
O	voice
O	in
O	national
O	government
O	.

O	But
O	Pretoria
O	may
O	instead
O	be
O	creating
O	a
O	climate
O	for
O	more
O	turmoil
O	and
O	uncertainty
O	in
O	this
O	racially
O	divided
O	country
O	.

O	As
O	other
O	repressive
O	governments
O	,
O	particularly
O	Poland
O	and
O	the
O	Soviet
O	Union
O	,
O	have
O	recently
O	discovered
O	,
O	initial
O	steps
O	to
O	open
O	up
O	society
O	can
O	create
O	a
O	momentum
O	for
O	radical
O	change
O	that
O	becomes
O	difficult
O	,
O	if
O	not
O	impossible
O	,
O	to
O	control
O	.

O	As
O	the
O	days
O	go
O	by
O	,
O	the
O	South
O	African
O	government
O	will
O	be
O	ever
O	more
O	hard
O	pressed
O	to
O	justify
O	the
O	continued
O	imprisonment
O	of
O	Mr.
O	Mandela
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	the
O	continued
O	banning
O	of
O	the
O	ANC
O	and
O	enforcement
O	of
O	the
O	state
O	of
O	emergency
O	.

O	If
O	it
O	does
O	n't
O	yield
O	on
O	these
O	matters
O	,
O	and
O	eventually
O	begin
O	talking
O	directly
O	to
O	the
O	ANC
O	,
O	the
O	expectations
O	and
O	promise
O	raised
O	by
O	yesterday
O	's
O	releases
O	will
O	turn
O	to
O	disillusionment
O	and
O	unrest
O	.

O	If
O	it
O	does
O	,
O	the
O	large
O	number
O	of
O	right-wing
O	whites
O	,
O	who
O	oppose
O	any
O	concessions
O	to
O	the
O	black
O	majority
O	,
O	will
O	step
O	up
O	their
O	agitation
O	and
O	threats
O	to
O	take
O	matters
O	into
O	their
O	own
O	hands
O	.

O	The
O	newly
O	released
O	ANC
O	leaders
O	also
O	will
O	be
O	under
O	enormous
O	pressure
O	.

O	The
O	government
O	is
O	watching
O	closely
O	to
O	see
O	if
O	their
O	presence
O	in
O	the
O	townships
O	leads
O	to
O	increased
O	anti-government
O	protests
O	and
O	violence
O	;
O	if
O	it
O	does
O	,
O	Pretoria
O	will
O	use
O	this
O	as
O	a
O	reason
O	to
O	keep
O	Mr.
O	Mandela
O	behind
O	bars
O	.

O	Pretoria
O	has
O	n't
O	forgotten
O	why
O	they
O	were
O	all
O	sentenced
O	to
O	life
O	imprisonment
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	place
O	:
O	for
O	sabotage
O	and
O	conspiracy
O	to
O	overthrow
O	the
O	government
O	.

O	In
O	addition
O	,
O	the
O	government
O	is
O	figuring
O	that
O	the
O	releases
O	could
O	create
O	a
O	split
O	between
O	the
O	internal
O	and
O	external
O	wings
O	of
O	the
O	ANC
O	and
O	between
O	the
O	newly
O	freed
O	leaders
O	and
O	those
O	activists
O	who
O	have
O	emerged
O	as
O	leaders
O	inside
O	the
O	country
O	during
O	their
O	imprisonment
O	.

O	In
O	order
O	to
O	head
O	off
O	any
O	divisions
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Mandela
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	meeting
O	with
O	his
O	colleagues
O	before
O	they
O	were
O	released
O	,
O	instructed
O	them
O	to
O	report
O	to
O	the
O	ANC
O	headquarters
O	in
O	Lusaka
O	as
O	soon
O	as
O	possible
O	.

O	The
O	men
O	also
O	will
O	be
O	faced
O	with
O	bridging
O	the
O	generation
O	gap
O	between
O	themselves
O	and
O	the
O	country
O	's
O	many
O	militant
O	black
O	youths
O	,
O	the
O	so-called
O	young
O	lions
O	who
O	are
O	anxious
O	to
O	see
O	the
O	old
O	lions
O	in
O	action
O	.

O	Says
O	Peter
O	Mokaba
O	,
O	president
O	of
O	the
O	South
O	African
O	Youth
O	Congress
O	:
B-CONTENT	``

I-CONTENT	.
I-CONTENT	''

O	They
O	never
O	considered
O	themselves
O	to
O	be
O	anything
O	else
O	.

O	At
O	last
O	night
O	's
O	rally
O	,
O	they
O	called
O	on
O	their
O	followers
O	to
O	be
O	firm

O	yet
O	disciplined

O	in
O	their
O	opposition
O	to

O	.

B-CONTENT	``

I-CONTENT	very
I-CONTENT	,
I-CONTENT	very

O	Andrew
O	Mlangeni
O	,
O	another
O	early
O	Umkhonto
