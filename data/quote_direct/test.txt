O	For

O	spurred
O	concern
O	about

O	And
O	10

O	And
O	I
O	think
O	a
O	lot
O	of
O	people
O	will
O	harp
O	on

O	.

O	It

O	Jeffrey
O	Yass
O	of

O	trader
O	Susquehanna
O	Investment
O	Group
O	said
O	2,000
O	S&P
O	contracts
O	were
O	for
O	sale
O	on
O	the
O	close
O	,
O	the
O	equivalent
O	of
O	$
O	330
O	million
O	in

O	.

O	But
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	buyers
O	.

O	While
O	Friday
O	's
O	debacle
O	involved
O	mainly
O	professional
O	traders
O	rather
O	than
O	investors
O	,
O	it
O	left
O	the
O	market
O	vulnerable
O	to
O	continued
O	selling
O	this
O	morning
O	,
O	traders
O	said
O	.

O	Stock-index
O	futures
O	contracts
O	settled
O	at
O	much
O	lower
O	prices
O	than
O	indexes
O	of
O	the
O	stock
O	market
O	itself
O	.

O	At
O	those
O	levels
O	,
O	stocks
O	are
O	set
O	up
O	to
O	be
O	hammered
O	by
O	index

O	nobody
O	knows
O	at
O	what

O	The
O	de-linkage
O	between
O	the
O	stock
O	and

O	markets
O	Friday
O	will
O	undoubtedly
O	cause

O	Also

O	told

O	that
O	the

O	7
O	--
O	the

O	to

O	.

O	Now
O	,
O	those
O	routes
O	are
O	n't
O	expected
O	to
O	begin

O	Boeing
O	is
O	also
O	supposed
O	to
O	send
O	to
O	America

O	another
O	757
O	twin-engine
O	aircraft
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	a
O	737
O	by

O	.

O	Those
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	are

O	--
O	have
O	been
O	affected
O	by
O	the
O	delays
O	in

O	.

O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	the

O	underscores
O	the

O	can
O	have

O	Quantum

O	Quantum

O	When

O	,
O	Quantum
O	's

O	85
O	cents
O	a

O	,
O	provided

O	In

O	,

O	,
O	has

O	dropped

O	That

O	hurts
O	Quantum
O	badly
O	,
O	because
O	its

O	cover
O	only
O	about

O	.

O	By

O	accounts
O	,
O	an

O	hint
O	of

O	would

O	Some

O	saw
O	the

O	as
O	an
O	effort
O	also
O	to
O	dispel
O	takeover
O	speculation
O	.

O	Whether
O	a
O	cash
O	crunch
O	might
O	eventually
O	force
O	the
O	company
O	to
O	cut
O	its
O	quarterly

O	%

O	has

O	Some

O	review

O	But

O	On

O	Quantum
O	confronts
O	a
O	disaster
O	at
O	its
O	plant
O	in
O	Morris
O	,
O	Ill
O	.

O	After
O	an
O	explosion
O	idled
O	the
O	plant
O	in
O	June
O	,
O	the
O	company
O	progressed
O	in
O	September
O	to
O	within
O	12
O	hours
O	of
O	completing
O	the
O	drawn-out
O	process
O	of
O	restarting
O	it
O	.

O	Then
O	a
O	second
O	explosion
O	occurred
O	.

O	Two
O	workers
O	died
O	and
O	six
O	remain
O	in
O	the
O	hospital
O	.

O	This
O	human
O	toll
O	adds
O	the
O	most
O	painful
O	dimension
O	yet
O	to
O	the
O	sudden
O	change
O	in
O	Quantum
O	's
O	fortunes
O	.

O	Until
O	this
O	year
O	,
O	the
O	company
O	had
O	been
O	steadily
O	lowering
O	its
O	accident
O	rate
O	and
O	picking
O	up
O	trade-group
O	safety
O	awards
O	.

O	A
O	prolonged
O	production
O	halt
O	at
O	the
O	plant
O	could
O	introduce
O	another
O	imponderable
O	into
O	Quantum
O	's
O	financial
O	future
O	.

O	When
O	a
O	plant
O	has
O	just
O	been
O	running
O	flat
O	out
O	to
O	meet
O	demand
O	,
O	calculating
O	lost
O	profit
O	and
O	thus
O	claims
O	under
O	business-interruption
O	insurance
O	is
O	straightforward
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	numbers
O	become
O	trickier
O	--
O	and
O	subject
O	to
O	dickering
O	between
O	insured
O	and
O	insurer
O	--
O	when
O	demand
O	is
O	shifting
O	.

O	,

O	In

O	The

O	by
O	a

O	of
O	smaller
O	exporters
O	,
O	such
O	as

O	.

O	The

O	had
O	about

O	2
O	%
O	of

O	domestic
O	steel
O	market
O	to
O	give
O	to
O	foreign
O	suppliers
O	in

O	talks
O	.

O	That
O	was

O	made
O	up
O	of

O	1
O	%
O	increase
O	in

O	and
O	1

O	.

O	Negotiators

O	have
O	another
O	1
O	%
O	of
O	the

O	.

O	These

O	George

O	The

O	,
O	Mr.

O	reflect
O	a

O	Although
O	Mr.

O	expects
O	that
O	line
O	of
O	business
O	to
O	strengthen
O	in
O	the
O	next

O	,
O	he
O	said
O	Elcotel
O	will
O	also
O	benefit
O	from
O	moving
O	into

O	.

O	Foremost
O	among
O	those
O	is
O	the
O	company
O	's
O	entrance
O	into
O	the
O	public
O	facsimile
O	business
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Pierce
O	said
O	.

O	Within

O	,
O	Elcotel
O	expects
O	to

O	Elcotel
O	will
O	provide
O	a

O	reader
O	for
O	the
O	machines
O	to
O	collect
O	,
O	store
O	and

O	.

O	Mr.
O	Pierce
O	said
O	Elcotel
O	should
O	realize
O	a
O	minimum
O	of
O	$
O	10
O	of
O	recurring
O	net
O	earnings
O	for
O	each
O	machine
O	each
O	month
O	.

O	Elcotel
O	has
O	also
O	developed
O	an
O	automatic
O	call
O	processor
O	that
O	will
O	make
O	further
O	use
O	of
O	the

O	's
O	system
O	for
O	automating
O	and
O	handling
O	credit-card
O	calls
O	and
O	collect
O	calls
O	.

O	Automatic
O	call
O	processors
O	will
O	provide
O	that
O	system
O	for
O	virtually
O	any
O	telephone
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Pierce
O	said
O	,
O	not
O	just
O	phones
O	produced

O	.

O	The

O	will
O	also

O	Mr.

O	estimated

O	The

O	superconcentrated
O	Lemon
O	Cheer
O	in
O	Japan
O	after
O	watching
O	the
O	success
O	of
O	Attack
O	.

O	When
O	Attack
O	hit
O	the

O	in
O	1987
O	,
O	P&G
O	's
O	share
O	of

O	fell

O	is

O	estimated

O	While
O	the
O	Japanese
O	have
O	embraced
O	the

O	packaging
O	and

O	where
O	growth
O	is
O	slow
O	and
O	liquids
O	have
O	gained
O	prominence
O	over
O	powders
O	.

O	The
O	company
O	may
O	have
O	chosen
O	to
O	market
O	the
O	product
O	under
O	the
O	Cheer
O	name
O	since
O	it
O	's

O	expanded

O	Tide
O	into

O	different
O	varieties
O	,
O	including
O	this
O	year
O	's
O	big
O	hit
O	,
O	Tide
O	with
O	Bleach
O	.

O	With
O	superconcentrates
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	n't
O	always
O	easy
O	to
O	persuade
O	consumers
O	that
O	less
O	is
O	more
O	;
O	many
O	people
O	tend
O	to
O	dump
O	too
O	much
O	detergent
O	into
O	the
O	washing
O	machine
O	,
O	believing
O	that
O	it
O	takes
O	a
O	cup
O	of
O	powder
O	to
O	really
O	clean
O	the
O	laundry
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	early
O	1980s
O	,
O	P&G
O	tried

O	a
O	concentrated
O	detergent
O	under
O	the
O	Ariel
O	brand
O	name
O	that
O	it
O	markets
O	in
O	Europe
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	product
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	n't
O	as
O	concentrated
O	as
O	the
O	new
O	Cheer
O	,
O	bombed
O	in
O	a
O	market
O	test
O	in
O	Denver
O	and
O	was
O	dropped
O	.

O	P&G
O	and
O	others
O	also
O	have
O	tried
O	repeatedly
O	to
O	hook
O	consumers
O	on
O	detergent
O	and
O	fabric
O	softener
O	combinations
O	in

O	,
O	but
O	they
O	have
O	n't
O	sold

O	despite

O	.

O	But
O	P&G
O	contends
O	the
O	new
O	Cheer
O	is
O	a
O	unique
O	formula
O	that
O	also
O	offers
O	an
O	ingredient
O	that
O	prevents
O	colors
O	from
O	fading
O	.

O	And
O	retailers
O	are
O	expected
O	to
O	embrace
O	the
O	product
O	,
O	in
O	part
O	because
O	it
O	will

O	Some

O	from

O	Trade
O	Representative
O	Carla

O	They

O	do

O	to

O	to

O	How
O	such

O	translate
O	into
O	policy
O	wo
O	n't

O	clear
O	for
O	months
O	.

O	American
O	and

O	officials
O	offered
O	several
O	theories
O	for
O	the
O	difference
O	in
O	approach
O	betwen
O	Mr.
O	Mosbacher
O	and
O	Mrs.
O	Hills
O	.

O	Many
O	called
O	it
O	simply
O	a
O	contrast
O	in
O	styles
O	.

O	But
O	some
O	saw
O	it
O	as
O	a
O	classic
O	negotiating
O	tactic
O	.

O	Others
O	said
O	the
O	Bush
O	administration
O	may
O	feel
O	the
O	rhetoric
O	on
O	both
O	sides
O	is
O	getting
O	out
O	of

O	.

O	And
O	some
O	said
O	it
O	reflected
O	the
O	growing
O	debate
O	in
O	Washington
O	over
O	pursuing
O	free
O	trade
O	with

O	versus
O	some

O	Asked
O	to

O	firmly

O	the
O	Super
O	301
O	provision

O	She
O	highlighted
O	exclusionary
O	business
O	practices
O	that
O	the
O	U.S.
O	government
O	has
O	identified
O	.

O	But
O	her
O	main
O	thrust
O	was
O	to
O	promote
O	the
O	importance
O	of
O	world-wide
O	free
O	trade
O	and
O	open
O	competition
O	.

O	She
O	said
O	the
O	trade
O	imbalance
O	was
O	mainly
O	due

O	macroeconomic
O	factors

O	should

O	Mrs.

O	raise
O	questions
O	,

O	about

O	The

O	the

O	market
O	has
O	been
O	stuck
O	around
O	10
O	%
O	for

O	Many

O	assuring
O	U.S.
O	companies
O	a
O	20

O	The
O	oil
O	industry
O	's
O	middling
O	profits
O	could
O	persist
O	through
O	the
O	rest
O	of
O	the
O	year
O	.

O	Major
O	oil
O	companies
O	in

O	,
O	largely
O	reflecting
O	deteriorating
O	chemical
O	prices

O	profitability

O	The
O	gasoline
O	picture
O	may
O	improve

O	likely
O	to

O	say
O	,
O	reducing
O	chances
O	that

O	equal

O	The

O	Glenn
O	Cox
O	,
O	president
O	of

O	said
O	in

O	interview

O	``
O	That
O	change
O	will
O	obviously
O	impact
O	third
O	and
O	fourth
O	quarter
O	earnings
O	''
O	for
O	the
O	industry
O	in

O	,
O	he
O	added
O	.

O	He
O	did
O	n't
O	forecast
O	Phillips
O	's
O	results
O	.

O	But
O	securities
O	analysts
O	say
O	Phillips
O	will
O	be
O	among
O	the
O	companies
O	hard-hit
O	by
O	weak
O	chemical
O	prices
O	and
O	will
O	probably
O	post
O	a
O	drop
O	in
O	third-quarter
O	earnings
O	.

O	So
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	many
O	analysts
O	predict
O	,
O	will
O	Exxon
O	Corp.
O	,
O	Chevron
O	Corp.
O	and
O	Amoco
O	Corp
O	.

O	Typical
O	is
O	what
O	happened
O	to
O	the
O	price
O	of
O	ethylene
O	,
O	a
O	major
O	commodity
O	chemical
O	produced
O	in
O	vast
O	amounts
O	by
O	many
O	oil
O	companies
O	.

O	It
O	has
O	plunged
O	13
O	%
O	since
O	July
O	to
O	around
O	26
O	cents
O	a
O	pound
O	.

O	A
O	year
O	ago

O	sold
O	for
O	33
O	cents
O	,
O	peaking
O	at
O	about
O	34
O	cents
O	last
O	December
O	.

O	A
O	big
O	reason
O	for
O	the
O	chemical
O	price
O	retreat
O	is
O	overexpansion
O	.

O	Beginning
O	in
O	mid-1987
O	,
O	prices
O	began
O	accelerating
O	as
O	a
O	growing
O	U.S.
O	economy
O	and
O	the
O	weak
O	dollar
O	spurred
O	demand
O	.

O	Companies
O	added
O	capacity
O	furiously
O	.

O	Now
O	,
O	greatly
O	increased
O	supplies
O	are
O	on
O	the
O	market
O	,
O	while
O	the
O	dollar
O	is
O	stronger
O	,
O	and
O	domestic
O	economic
O	growth
O	is
O	slower

O	Third-quarter

O	The

O	for

O	is
O	questioning

O	.
O	C.
O	Olivetti
O	&

O	supplied
O	militarily
O	valuable

O	Oct.

O	But
O	the

O	fully
O	with
O	existing
O	export-control
O	procedures
O	before
O	it
O	will
O	support
O	further
O	liberalization
O	.

O	To
O	make
O	its
O	point
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	challenging
O	the
O	Italian
O	government
O	to
O	explain
O	reports
O	that

O	Italian
O	President

O	promised
O	a

O	President

O	Although
O	the

O	still
O	an

O	Mr.

O	moved
O	the

O	in
O	the
O	direction
O	of
O	gradual

O	when

O	But
O	more
O	recently
O	,
O	the

O	and
O	the

O	Department
O	openly
O	feuded

O	should
O	liberalize

O	Shortly

O	But
O	HOFI
O	's

O	about

O	.

O	Ideal
O	's
O	directors
O	rejected
O	that
O	offer
O	,
O	although
O	they
O	said
O	they
O	endorsed
O	the

O	proposal
O	.

O	Under
O	the
O	agreement
O	,
O	HOFI
O	will
O	own
O	87.2

O	Ideal

O	current
O	operations
O	will
O	represent
O	about
O	39.2

O	The
O	transaction
O	is
O	subject
O	to
O	a

O	agreement
O	and

O	Ideal
O	said

O	if
O	rain
O	does
O	n't
O	fall
O	soon
O	across
O	many
O	of
O	the

O	Plains
O	'
O	wheat-growing
O	areas
O	,
O	yields
O	in
O	the
O	crop
O	now
O	being
O	planted
O	could
O	be
O	reduced
O	,
O	further
O	squeezing
O	supplies
O	.

O	Also
O	supporting
O	prices
O	are
O	expectations
O	that
O	the
O	Soviet
O	Union
O	will
O	place
O	substantial
O	buying
O	orders
O	over
O	the
O	next
O	few
O	months

O	By

O	before

O	is
O	harvested
O	--
O	are
O	projected
O	to
O	drop
O	to
O	443
O	million
O	bushels
O	.

O	That
O	would
O	be
O	the
O	lowest
O	level
O	since
O	the
O	early
O	1970s
O	.

O	Stocks
O	were
O	698

O	on
O	May
O	31
O	of
O	this
O	year
O	.

O	In
O	response
O	to
O	dwindling
O	domestic
O	supplies
O	,
O	Agriculture
O	Secretary
O	Clayton
O	Yeutter
O	last
O	month
O	said
O	the
O	U.S.
O	government
O	would
O	slightly
O	increase
O	the
O	number
O	of
O	acres
O	farmers
O	can
O	plant
O	in
O	wheat
O	for
O	next
O	year
O	and
O	still
O	qualify
O	for
O	federal
O	support
O	payments
O	.

O	The
O	government
O	estimates
O	that
O	the
O	new
O	plan
O	will
O	boost
O	production
O	next
O	year
O	by
O	about
O	66
O	million
O	bushels
O	.

O	It
O	now
O	estimates
O	production
O	for
O	next
O	year
O	at
O	just
O	under
O	2.6
O	billion
O	bushels
O	,
O	compared
O	with
O	this
O	year
O	's
O	estimated
O	2.04
O	billion
O	and
O	a
O	drought-stunted
O	1.81
O	billion
O	in
O	1988
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	full
O	effect
O	on
O	prices
O	of
O	the
O	winter
O	wheat
O	now
O	being
O	planted
O	wo
O	n't
O	be
O	felt
O	until
O	the
O	second
O	half
O	of
O	next
O	year
O	.

O	Until
O	then
O	,
O	limited
O	stocks
O	are
O	likely
O	to
O	keep
O	prices
O	near
O	the
O	$
O	4-a-bushel
O	level
O	,
O	analysts
O	say
O	.

O	On
O	the
O	Chicago
O	Board
O	of
O	Trade
O	Friday
O	,
O	wheat
O	for
O	December
O	delivery
O	settled
O	at
O	$
O	4.0675
O	a
O	bushel
O	,
O	unchanged
O	.

O	In
O	theory
O	at
O	least
O	,
O	tight
O	supplies
O	next
O	spring
O	could
O	leave
O	the
O	wheat
O	futures
O	market
O	susceptible
O	to
O	a
O	supply-demand
O	squeeze
O	,
O	said
O	Daniel
O	Basse
O	,
O	a
O	futures
O	analyst
O	with
O	AgResource
O	Co.
O	in
O	Chicago
O	.

O	Such
O	a
O	situation
O	can
O	wreak
O	havoc
O	,
O	as
O	was
O	shown
O	by
O	the
O	emergency
O	that
O	developed
O	in
O	soybean
O	futures
O	trading
O	this
O	summer
O	on
O	the
O	Chicago
O	Board
O	of
O	Trade
O	.

O	In
O	July
O	,
O	the
O	CBOT
O	ordered
O	Ferruzzi
O	Finanziaria

O	A.
O	to
O	liquidate
O	futures
O	positions
O	equal
O	to
O	about
O	23
O	million
O	bushels
O	of
O	soybeans
O	.

O	The
O	exchange
O	said
O	it
O	feared
O	that
O	some
O	members
O	would
O	n't
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	find
O	enough
O	soybeans
O	to
O	deliver
O	and
O	would
O	have
O	to
O	default
O	on
O	their
O	contractual
O	obligation
O	to
O	the
O	Italian
O	conglomerate
O	,
O	which
O	had
O	refused
O	requests
O	to
O	reduce
O	its
O	holdings
O	.

O	Ferruzzi
O	has
O	denied
O	it
O	was
O	trying

O	futures
O	market

O	For

O	,
O	in

O	,
O	40
O	%
O	or
O	more
O	of
O	the

O	.

O	That

O	climbs
O	to
O	about
O	47
O	%
O	in
O	wheat-growing
O	portions
O	of
O	Kansas
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	.

O	The
O	Soviet
O	Union
O	has
O	n't
O	given
O	any
O	clear
O	indication
O	of
O	its
O	wheat
O	purchase
O	plans
O	,
O	but
O	many
O	analysts
O	expect

O	orders
O	for
O	U.S.
O	wheat
O	in
O	the

O	this

O	Juice
O	Traders
O	will

O	and
O	how
O	far
O	the

O	Friday
O	will

O	Late
O	Thursday
O	,
O	after
O	the
O	close
O	of
O	trading
O	,
O	the
O	market
O	received
O	what
O	would
O	normally
O	have
O	been
O	a
O	bullish
O	U.S.
O	Department
O	of
O	Agriculture
O	estimate
O	of
O	the
O	1989-90
O	Florida
O	orange
O	crop
O	.

O	It
O	was
O	near
O	the
O	low
O	range
O	of
O	estimates
O	,
O	at
O	130
O	million
O	90-pound
O	boxes
O	,
O	compared
O	with
O	146.6
O	million
O	boxes
O	last
O	season
O	.

O	However
O	,
O	as
O	expected
O	,
O	Brazil
O	waited
O	for
O	the
O	crop
O	estimate
O	to
O	come
O	out
O	and
O	then
O	cut
O	the

O	erased
O	whatever
O	supportive
O	effect
O	the
O	U.S.
O	report
O	might
O	have
O	had
O	and
O	sent
O	the

O	down
O	as
O	much
O	as
O	6.55
O	cents
O	a

O	The

O	appeared
O	to

O	even

O	where

O	It

O	Mr.

O	The

O	The

O	General

O	,
O	in
O	a
O	series
O	of
O	moves
O	that
O	angered
O	union
O	officials
O	in
O	the
O	U.S.
O	and
O	Canada
O	,
O	has
O	signaled
O	that
O	as
O	many
O	as
O	five
O	North
O	American
O	assembly
O	plants
O	may
O	not
O	survive
O	the
O	mid-1990s
O	as
O	the
O	corporation
O	struggles
O	to
O	cut
O	its
O	excess
O	vehicle-making
O	capacity
O	.

O	In
O	announcements
O	to
O	workers
O	late
O	last
O	week
O	,
O	GM
O	effectively
O	signed
O	death
O	notices
O	for
O	two
O	full-sized
O	van
O	assembly
O	plants
O	,
O	and
O	cast
O	serious
O	doubt
O	on
O	the
O	futures
O	of
O	three
O	U.S.
O	car
O	factories
O	.

O	GM
O	is
O	under
O	intense
O	pressure
O	to
O	close
O	factories
O	that
O	became
O	unprofitable
O	as
O	the
O	giant
O	auto
O	maker
O	's
O	U.S.
O	market
O	share
O	skidded
O	during
O	the
O	past
O	decade
O	.

O	The
O	company
O	,
O	currently
O	using
O	about
O	80
O	%
O	of
O	its
O	North
O	American
O	vehicle
O	capacity
O	,
O	has
O	vowed
O	it
O	will
O	run
O	at
O	100
O	%
O	of
O	capacity
O	by
O	1992
O	.

O	Just
O	a
O	month
O	ago
O	,
O	GM
O	announced
O	it
O	would
O	make
O	an
O	aging
O	assembly
O	plant
O	in
O	Lakewood
O	,
O	Ga.
O	,
O	the
O	eighth
O	U.S.
O	assembly
O	facility
O	to
O	close
O	since
O	1987
O	.

O	Now
O	,
O	GM
O	appears
O	to
O	be
O	stepping
O	up
O	the
O	pace
O	of
O	its
O	factory
O	consolidation
O	to
O	get
O	in
O	shape
O	for
O	the
O	1990s
O	.

O	One
O	reason
O	is
O	mounting
O	competition
O	from
O	new
O	Japanese
O	car
O	plants
O	in
O	the
O	U.S.
O	that
O	are
O	pouring
O	out
O	more
O	than
O	one
O	million
O	vehicles
O	a
O	year
O	at
O	costs
O	lower
O	than
O	GM
O	can
O	match
O	.

O	Another
O	is
O	that
O	United
O	Auto
O	Workers
O	union
O	officials
O	have
O	signaled
O	they
O	want
O	tighter
O	no-layoff
O	provisions
O	in
O	the
O	new
O	Big
O	Three
O	national
O	contract
O	that
O	will
O	be
O	negotiated
O	next
O	year
O	.

O	GM
O	officials
O	want
O	to
O	get
O	their
O	strategy
O	to
O	reduce
O	capacity
O	and
O	the
O	work
O	force
O	in
O	place
O	before
O	those
O	talks
O	begin
O	.

O	The
O	problem
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	is
O	that
O	GM
O	's
O	moves
O	are
O	coming
O	at
O	a
O	time
O	when
O	UAW
O	leaders
O	are
O	trying
O	to
O	silence
O	dissidents
O	who
O	charge
O	the
O	union
O	is
O	too
O	passive
O	in
O	the
O	face
O	of
O	GM
O	layoffs
O	.

O	Against
O	that
O	backdrop
O	,
O	UAW
O	Vice
O	President
O	Stephen
O	P.
O	Yokich
O	,
O	who
O	recently
O	became
O	head
O	of
O	the
O	union
O	's
O	GM
O	department
O	,
O	issued
O	a
O	statement
O	Friday
O	blasting
O	GM
O	's
O	``
O	flagrant
O	insensitivity
O	''
O	toward
O	union
O	members
O	.

O	The
O	auto
O	maker
O	's
O	decision
O	to
O	let
O	word
O	of
O	the
O	latest
O	shutdowns
O	and
O	product
O	reassignments
O	trickle
O	out
O	in
O	separate
O	communiques
O	to
O	the
O	affected
O	plants
O	showed
O	``
O	disarray
O	''
O	and
O	an
O	``
O	inability
O	or
O	unwillingness
O	to
O	provide
O	consistent
O	information
O	,
O	''
O	Mr.
O	Yokich
O	said
O	.

O	GM
O	officials
O	told
O	workers
O	late
O	last
O	week
O	of
O	the
O	following
O	moves
O	:
O	Production
O	of
O	full-sized
O	vans
O	will
O	be
O	consolidated
O	into
O	a
O	single
O	plant
O	in
O	Flint
O	,
O	Mich
O	.

O	That
O	means
O	two
O	plants
O	--
O	one
O	in
O	Scarborough
O	,
O	Ontario
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	other
O	in
O	Lordstown
O	,
O	Ohio
O	--
O	probably
O	will
O	be
O	shut
O	down
O	after
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	1991
O	.

O	The
O	shutdowns
O	will
O	idle
O	about
O	3,000
O	Canadian
O	assembly
O	workers
O	and
O	about
O	2,500
O	workers
O	in
O	Ohio
O	.

O	Robert
O	White
O	,
O	Canadian
O	Auto
O	Workers
O	union
O	president
O	,
O	used
O	the
O	impending
O	Scarborough
O	shutdown
O	to
O	criticize
O	the
O	U.S.-Canada
O	free
O	trade
O	agreement
O	and
O	its
O	champion
O	,
O	Prime
O	Minister
O	Brian
O	Mulroney
O	.

O	But
O	Canadian
O	auto
O	workers
O	may
O	benefit
O	from
O	a
O	separate
O	GM
O	move
O	that
O	affects
O	three
O	U.S.
O	car
O	plants
O	and
O	one
O	in
O	Quebec
O	.

O	Workers
O	at
O	plants
O	in
O	Van
O	Nuys
O	,
O	Calif.
O	,
O	Oklahoma
O	City
O	and
O	Pontiac
O	,
O	Mich.
O	,
O	were
O	told
O	their
O	facilities
O	are
O	no
O	longer
O	being
O	considered
O	to
O	build
O	the
O	next
O	generation
O	of
O	the
O	Pontiac
O	Firebird
O	and
O	Chevrolet
O	Camaro
O	muscle
O	cars
O	.

O	GM
O	is
O	studying
O	whether
O	it
O	can
O	build
O	the
O	new
O	Camaro-Firebird
O	profitably
O	at
O	a
O	plant
O	in
O	St.
O	Therese
O	,
O	Quebec
O	,
O	company
O	and
O	union
O	officials
O	said
O	.

O	That
O	announcement
O	left
O	union
O	officials
O	in
O	Van
O	Nuys
O	and
O	Oklahoma
O	City
O	uncertain
O	about
O	their
O	futures
O	.

O	The
O	Van
O	Nuys
O	plant
O	,
O	which
O	employs
O	about
O	3,000
O	workers
O	,
O	does
O	n't
O	have
O	a
O	product
O	to
O	build
O	after
O	1993
O	.

O	Jerry
O	Shrieves
O	,
O	UAW
O	local
O	president
O	,
O	said
O	the
O	facility
O	was
O	asked
O	to
O	draw
O	up
O	plans
O	to
O	continue
O	working
O	as
O	a
O	``
O	flex
O	plant
O	,
O	''
O	which
O	could
O	build
O	several
O	different
O	types
O	of
O	products
O	on
O	short
O	notice
O	to
O	satisfy
O	demand
O	.

O	At
O	the
O	Oklahoma
O	City
O	plant
O	,
O	which
O	employs
O	about
O	6,000
O	workers
O	building
O	the
O	eight-year-old
O	A-body
O	mid-sized
O	cars
O	,
O	Steve
O	Featherston
O	,
O	UAW
O	local
O	vice
O	president
O	,
O	said
O	the
O	plant
O	has
O	no
O	new
O	product
O	lined
O	up
O	,
O	and
O	``
O	none
O	of
O	us
O	knows
O	''
O	when
O	the
O	A-body
O	cars
O	will
O	die
O	.

O	He
O	said
O	he
O	believes
O	GM
O	has
O	plans
O	to
O	keep
O	building
O	A-body
O	cars
O	into
O	the
O	mid-1990s
O	.

O	At
O	Pontiac
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	the
O	Camaro-Firebird
O	decision
O	appears
O	to
O	erase
O	UAW
O	hopes
O	that
O	GM
O	would
O	reopen
O	the
O	shuttered
O	assembly
O	plant
O	that
O	last
O	built
O	the
O	plastic-bodied
O	,
O	two-seater
O	Pontiac
O	Fiero
O	model
O	.

O	The
O	Fiero
O	plant
O	was
O	viewed
O	as
O	a
O	model
O	of
O	union-management
O	cooperation
O	at
O	GM
O	before
O	slow
O	sales
O	of
O	the
O	Fiero
O	forced
O	the
O	company
O	to

O	When
O	Justice
O	William
O	Brennan
O	marks
O	the
O	start
O	of
O	his
O	34th
O	year
O	on
O	the
O	Supreme
O	Court
O	today
O	,
O	the
O	occasion
O	will
O	differ
O	sharply
O	from
O	previous
O	anniversaries
O	of
O	his
O	tenure
O	.

O	For
O	the
O	first
O	time
O	,
O	the
O	83-year-old
O	justice
O	finds
O	his
O	influence
O	almost
O	exclusively
O	in
O	dissent
O	,
O	rather
O	than
O	as
O	a
O	force
O	in
O	the
O	high
O	court
O	's
O	majority
O	.

O	This
O	role
O	reversal
O	holds
O	true
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	,
O	for
O	his
O	three
O	liberal
O	and
O	moderate
O	allies
O	,
O	Justices
O	Thurgood
O	Marshall
O	,
O	Harry
O	Blackmun
O	and
O	John
O	Stevens
O	.

O	But
O	are
O	these
O	four
O	players
O	,
O	three
O	of
O	them
O	in
O	their
O	80s
O	,
O	ready
O	to
O	assume
O	a
O	different
O	role
O	after
O	88
O	years
O	,
O	collectively
O	,
O	of
O	service
O	on
O	the
O	high
O	court
O	?

O	Every
O	indication
O	is
O	that
O	the
O	four
O	are
O	prepared
O	to
O	accept
O	this
O	new
O	role
O	,
O	and
O	the
O	frustrations
O	that
O	go
O	with
O	it
O	,
O	but
O	in
O	different
O	ways
O	.

O	Justices
O	Brennan
O	and
O	Stevens
O	appear
O	philosophical
O	about
O	it
O	;
O	Justices
O	Marshall
O	and
O	Blackmun
O	appear
O	fighting
O	mad
O	.

O	The
O	four
O	justices
O	are
O	no
O	newcomers
O	to
O	dissent
O	,
O	often
O	joining
O	forces
O	in
O	the
O	past
O	decade
O	to
O	criticize
O	the
O	court
O	's
O	conservative
O	drift
O	.

O	But
O	always
O	,
O	in
O	years
O	past
O	,
O	they
O	have
O	bucked
O	the
O	trend
O	and
O	have
O	been
O	able
O	to
O	pick
O	up
O	a
O	fifth
O	vote
O	to
O	eke
O	out
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	major
O	victories
O	in
O	civil
O	rights
O	and
O	liberties
O	cases
O	.

O	Now
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	as
O	the
O	court
O	's
O	new
O	five-member
O	conservative
O	majority
O	continues
O	to
O	solidify
O	,
O	victories
O	for
O	the
O	liberals
O	are
O	rare
O	.

O	The
O	change
O	is
O	most
O	dramatic
O	for
O	Justice
O	Brennan
O	,
O	the
O	last
O	survivor
O	of
O	the
O	mid-1960s
O	liberal
O	majority
O	under
O	Chief
O	Justice
O	Earl
O	Warren
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	seven
O	Supreme
O	Court
O	terms
O	from
O	the
O	fall
O	of
O	1962
O	through
O	the
O	spring
O	of
O	1967
O	,
O	the
O	height
O	of
O	the
O	Warren
O	Court
O	's
O	power
O	,
O	Justice
O	Brennan
O	cast
O	only
O	25
O	dissenting
O	votes
O	in
O	555
O	cases
O	decided
O	by
O	the
O	court
O	.

O	Last

O	in
O	133

O	,
O	with
O	the
O	contentious
O	flag-burning
O	ruling
O	as
O	his
O	only
O	big
O	victory
O	.

O	But
O	Justice
O	Brennan
O	foresaw
O	his
O	new

O	,
O	strongly
O	defending
O	the
O	importance
O	of

O	Associates

O	Justice
O	Stevens
O	,
O	69

O	most
O	philosophical
O	of
O	the
O	dissenters
O	about
O	his

O	,
O	in

O	because
O	he
O	may
O	be

O	The

O	sold
O	the

O	institutions
O	,
O	in

O	,
O	but
O	low
O	bids
O	prevented
O	the

O	of
O	a

O	.

O	The
O	four
O	S&Ls
O	were
O	sold
O	to
O	large

O	,
O	as

O	of

O	initiated
O	by

O	legislation
O	two
O	months

O	Two
O	of

O	thrifts
O	were
O	sold
O	to
O	NCNB
O	Corp.
O	,
O	Charlotte
O	,
O	N.C.
O	,
O	which
O	has
O	aggressively
O	expanded
O	its
O	markets
O	,
O	particularly
O	in
O	Texas
O	and
O	Florida
O	.

O	A
O	Canadian
O	bank
O	bought
O	another
O	thrift
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	first
O	RTC
O	transaction
O	with
O	a
O	foreign
O	bank
O	.

O	Under
O	these
O	deals
O	,
O	the
O	RTC
O	sells
O	just
O	the
O	deposits
O	and
O	the
O	healthy

O	.

O	These
O	``

O	transactions
O	leave
O	the

O	,
O	mostly
O	real

O	,
O	with
O	the
O	government
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sold
O	later
O	.

O	In
O	these
O	four
O	,
O	for

O	,
O	the
O	RTC
O	is
O	stuck
O	with
O	$
O	4.51

O	Acquirers

O	%

O	branch

O	,
O	roughly
O	in

O	with
O	what

O	were
O	expecting
O	.

O	The

O	will
O	also
O	be

O	However
O	,
O	because
O	the
O	guaranteed

O	is
O	being
O	lowered
O	,
O	ad

O	be

O	according
O	to
O	Richard

O	.

O	Time

O	of
O	some
O	other
O	mass-circulation
O	magazines
O	that
O	in
O	recent
O	years
O	have
O	challenged
O	the
O	publishing
O	myth
O	that
O	maintaining
O	artificially
O	high
O	,
O	and
O	expensive
O	,
O	circulations
O	is
O	the
O	way
O	to
O	draw
O	advertisers
O	.

O	have
O	cut
O	their
O	massive
O	circulation
O	rate
O	bases
O	to
O	eliminate
O	marginal
O	circulation
O	and
O	hold
O	down
O	rates
O	for
O	advertisers
O	.

O	Deep
O	discounts
O	in
O	subscriptions
O	and
O	offers
O	of
O	free
O	clock
O	radios
O	and

O	have
O	become

O	attracting
O	new
O	subscribers
O	in
O	the
O	hyper-competitive

O	of

O	.

O	But
O	Time
O	,
O	as
O	part
O	of
O	the
O	more
O	cost-conscious
O	Time
O	Warner
O	,
O	wants
O	to
O	wean
O	itself
O	away
O	from
O	expensive
O	gimmicks
O	.

O	Besides
O	,
O	Time
O	executives

O	However

O	The

O	Though
O	the

O	The

O	that
O	signals
O	that
O	regulators
O	have
O	deep
O	concerns
O	about
O	an
O	institution
O	's
O	health
O	.

O	In
O	March
O	,
O	regulators
O	labeled
O	CenTrust
O	a
O	``
O	troubled
O	institution
O	,
O	''
O	largely
O	because
O	of
O	its
O	big
O	junk-bond
O	holdings
O	and
O	its
O	operating
O	losses
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	same
O	month
O	,
O	the
O	Office
O	of
O	Thrift
O	Supervision
O	ordered
O	the
O	institution
O	to
O	stop
O	paying
O	common
O	stock
O	dividends
O	until
O	its
O	operations
O	were
O	on
O	track
O	.

O	For
O	the
O	nine
O	months
O	ended
O	June
O	30
O	,
O	CenTrust
O	had
O	a
O	net
O	loss
O	of
O	$
O	21.3
O	million
O	,
O	compared
O	with
O	year-earlier
O	net
O	income
O	of
O	$
O	52.8
O	million
O	.

O	CenTrust
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	Florida
O	's
O	largest
O	thrift
O	,
O	holds
O	one
O	of
O	the
O	largest
O	junk-bond
O	portfolios
O	of
O	any
O	thrift
O	in
O	the
O	nation
O	.

O	Since
O	April
O	,
O	it
O	has
O	pared
O	its
O	high-yield
O	bond
O	holdings
O	to
O	about
O	$
O	890
O	million
O	from
O	$
O	1.35
O	billion
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Paul
O	said
O	only
O	about
O	$
O	150
O	million
O	of
O	the
O	current
O	holdings
O	are
O	tradeable
O	securities
O	registered
O	with
O	the
O	Securities
O	and
O	Exchange
O	Commission
O	.

O	The
O	remainder
O	,
O	he
O	said
O	,
O	are
O	commercial
O	loan
O	participations
O	,
O	or
O	private
O	placements
O	,
O	that
O	are
O	n't
O	filed
O	with
O	the
O	SEC
O	and
O	do
O	n't
O	have
O	a
O	ready
O	market
O	.

O	CenTrust
O	and
O	regulators
O	have
O	been
O	in
O	a
O	dispute
O	over
O	market
O	valuations
O	for
O	the
O	junk
O	bonds
O	.

O	The
O	Office
O	of
O	Thrift
O	Supervision
O	has
O	been
O	hounding
O	CenTrust
O	to
O	provide
O	current
O	market
O	values
O	for
O	its
O	holdings
O	,
O	but
O	CenTrust
O	has
O	said
O	it
O	ca
O	n't
O	easily
O	obtain
O	such
O	values
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	relative
O	illiquidity
O	of
O	the
O	bonds
O	and
O	lack
O	of
O	a
O	ready
O	market
O	.

O	Regulators
O	have
O	become
O	increasingly
O	antsy
O	about
O	CenTrust
O	's
O	and
O	other
O	thrifts
O	'
O	junk-bond
O	holdings
O	in
O	light
O	of
O	the
O	recent
O	federal
O	thrift
O	bailout
O	legislation
O	and
O	the
O	recent
O	deep
O	decline
O	in
O	the
O	junk-bond
O	market
O	.

O	The
O	legislation
O	requires
O	thrifts
O	to
O	divest
O	themselves
O	of
O	junk
O	bonds
O	in
O	the
O	new
O	,
O	somber
O	regulatory
O	climate
O	.

O	In
O	American
O	Stock
O	Exchange
O	composite
O	trading
O	Friday
O	,
O	CenTrust
O	common
O	shares
O	closed
O	at
O	$
O	3
O	,
O	down
O	12.5
O	cents
O	.

O	In
O	a
O	statement
O	Friday
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Paul
O	challenged
O	the
O	regulators
O	'
O	decision
O	,
O	saying
O	the
O	thrift
O	's
O	operating
O	losses
O	and
O	``
O	apparent
O	''
O	junk-bond
O	losses
O	``
O	have
O	been
O	substantially
O	offset
O	by
O	gains
O	in
O	other
O	activities
O	of
O	the
O	bank
O	.
O	''

O	He
O	also
O	said
O	substantial
O	reserves
O	have
O	been
O	set
O	aside
O	for
O	possible
O	losses
O	from
O	the
O	junk
O	bonds
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	third
O	quarter
O	,
O	for
O	instance
O	,
O	CenTrust
O	added
O	$
O	22.5
O	million
O	to
O	its
O	general
O	reserves
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Paul
O	said
O	the
O	regulators
O	should
O	instead
O	move
O	ahead
O	with
O	approving
O	CenTrust
O	's
O	request
O	to
O	sell
O	63
O	of
O	its
O	71
O	branches
O	to
O	Great
O	Western
O	Bank
O	,
O	a
O	unit
O	of
O	Great
O	Western
O	Financial
O	Corp.
O	based
O	in
O	Beverly
O	Hills
O	,
O	Calif
O	.

O	The
O	branch
O	sale
O	is
O	the
O	centerpiece
O	of
O	CenTrust
O	's
O	strategy
O	to
O	transform
O	itself
O	into
O	a
O	traditional
O	S&L
O	from
O	a
O	high-flying
O	institution
O	that
O	relied
O	heavily
O	on
O	securities
O	trading
O	for
O	profits
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	Mr.
O	Paul
O	.

O	Most
O	analysts
O	and
O	thrift
O	executives
O	had
O	expected
O	a
O	decision
O	on
O	the
O	proposed
O	transaction
O	,
O	which
O	was
O	announced
O	in
O	July
O	,
O	long
O	before
O	now
O	.

O	Many
O	interpret
O	the
O	delay
O	as
O	an
O	indication
O	that
O	regulators
O	are
O	skeptical
O	about
O	the
O	proposal
O	.

O	Branches
O	and
O	deposits
O	can
O	be
O	sold
O	at
O	a
O	premium
O	in
O	the
O	event
O	federal
O	regulators
O	take
O	over
O	an
O	institution
O	.

O	CenTrust
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	touts
O	the
O	branch
O	sale
O	,
O	saying
O	it
O	would
O	bring
O	in
O	$
O	150
O	million
O	and
O	reduce
O	the
O	thrift
O	's
O	assets
O	to
O	$
O	6.7
O	billion
O	from
O	$
O	9
O	billion
O	.

O	It
O	said
O	the
O	sale
O	would
O	give
O	it
O	positive
O	tangible
O	capital
O	of
O	$
O	82
O	million
O	,
O	or
O	about
O	1.2
O	%
O	of
O	assets
O	,
O	from
O	a
O	negative
O	$
O	33
O	million
O	as
O	of
O	Sept.
O	30
O	,
O	thus
O	bringing
O	CenTrust
O	close
O	to
O	regulatory
O	standards
O	.

O	CenTrust
O	said
O	the
O	branch
O	sale
O	would
O	also
O	reduce
O	the
O	company
O	's
O	large
O	amount
O	of
O	good
O	will
O	by
O	about
O	$
O	180
O	million
O	.

O	Critics
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	say
O	the
O	branch
O	sale
O	will
O	make
O	CenTrust
O	more
O	dependent
O	than
O	ever
O	on
O	brokered
O	deposits
O	and
O	junk
O	bonds
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Paul
O	counters
O	that
O	he
O	intends
O	to
O	further
O	pare
O	the
O	size
O	of
O	CenTrust
O	by
O	not
O	renewing
O	more
O	than
O	$
O	1
O	billion
O	of
O	brokered
O	certificates
O	of
O	deposit
O	when
O	they
O	come
O	due
O	.

O	The
O	thrift
O	is
O	also
O	working
O	to
O	unload
O	its
O	junk-bond
O	portfolio
O	by
O	continuing
O	to
O	sell
O	off
O	the
O	bonds
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	plans
O	to
O	eventually
O	place
O	some
O	of
O	them
O	in
O	a
O	separate
O	affiliate
O	,
O	as
O	required
O	under
O	the
O	new
O	thrift
O	law
O	.


O	On
O	a
O	recent
O	Saturday
O	night
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	midst
O	of
O	West
O	Germany
O	's
O	most
O	popular
O	prime-time
O	show
O	,
O	a
O	contestant
O	bet
O	the
O	host
O	that
O	she
O	could
O	name
O	any
O	of
O	100
O	different
O	cheeses
O	after
O	just
O	one
O	nibble
O	,
O	while
O	blindfolded
O	.

O	The
O	woman
O	won
O	the
O	bet
O	.

O	But
O	perhaps
O	even
O	more
O	remarkable
O	,
O	the
O	three-hour-show
O	,
O	``
O	Wetten
O	Dass
O	''
O	-LRB-
O	Make
O	a
O	Bet
O	-RRB-
O	,
O	regularly
O	wins
O	the
O	top
O	slot
O	in
O	the
O	country
O	's
O	TV
O	ratings
O	,
O	sometimes
O	drawing
O	as
O	many
O	as
O	50
O	%
O	of
O	West
O	German
O	households
O	.

O	As
O	the
O	1992
O	economic
O	integration
O	approaches
O	,
O	Europe
O	's
O	cultural
O	curators
O	have
O	taken
O	to
O	the
O	ramparts
O	against
O	American
O	``
O	cultural
O	imperialism
O	,
O	''
O	threatening
O	to
O	impose
O	quotas
O	against
O	such
O	pop
O	invaders
O	as
O	``
O	Dallas
O	,
O	''
O	``
O	Miami
O	Vice
O	''
O	and
O	``
O	L.A.
O	Law
O	.
O	''

O	But
O	much
O	of
O	what
O	the
O	Europeans
O	want
O	to
O	protect
O	seems
O	every
O	bit
O	as
O	cheesy
O	as
O	what
O	they
O	are
O	trying
O	to
O	keep
O	out
O	.

O	The
O	most
O	militant
O	opposition
O	to
O	American
O	TV
O	imports
O	has
O	come
O	from
O	French
O	television
O	and
O	movie
O	producers
O	,
O	who
O	have
O	demanded
O	quotas
O	ensuring
O	that
O	a
O	full
O	60
O	%
O	of
O	Europe
O	's
O	TV
O	shows
O	be
O	produced
O	in
O	Europe
O	.

O	So
O	far
O	,
O	the
O	French
O	have
O	failed
O	to
O	win
O	enough
O	broad-based
O	support
O	to
O	prevail
O	.

O	A
O	glance
O	through
O	the
O	television
O	listings
O	and
O	a
O	few
O	twists
O	of
O	the
O	European
O	television
O	dial
O	suggest
O	one
O	reason
O	why
O	.

O	While
O	there
O	are
O	some
O	popular
O	action
O	and
O	drama
O	series
O	,
O	few
O	boast
O	the
O	high
O	culture
O	and
O	classy
O	production
O	values
O	one
O	might
O	expect
O	.

O	More
O	European
O	air
O	time
O	is
O	filled
O	with
O	low-budget
O	game
O	shows
O	,
O	variety
O	hours
O	,
O	movies
O	and
O	talk
O	shows
O	,
O	many
O	of
O	which
O	are
O	authorized
O	knock-offs
O	of
O	their
O	American
O	counterparts
O	.

O	One
O	of

O	features
O	semi-celebrities
O	seeking

O	for

O	A

O	show
O	has
O	as
O	its
O	host
O	a
O	Belgian
O	pretending
O	to
O	be
O	Italian
O	.

O	One
O	of

O	,
O	``

O	a

O	that
O	viewers
O	clamored
O	to

O	a
O	chocolate
O	product
O	,
O	``
O	Cacao

O	whose

O	evening
O	of
O	fun
O	on
O	``
O	Wetten

O	''
O	a

O	won
O	a
O	bet
O	with
O	the
O	show
O	's
O	host
O	,
O	Thomas
O	Gottschalk
O	,
O	that
O	he
O	could
O	identify
O	300
O	German
O	dialects
O	over

O	.

O	A
O	celebrity
O	guest
O	,
O	U.S.
O	Ambassador
O	to
O	West
O	Germany
O	Richard
O	Burt
O	,
O	also
O	won
O	a

O	that
O	someone
O	could
O	pile
O	up
O	$
O	150
O	worth
O	of
O	quarters
O	on
O	a
O	slanted
O	coin
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Burt
O	nonetheless
O	paid
O	the
O	penalty
O	as
O	if
O	he
O	had
O	lost
O	,
O	agreeing
O	to
O	spend
O	a
O	day
O	with
O	West
O	German
O	Foreign
O	Minister

O	Genscher
O	frying

O	If
O	this
O	seems
O	like
O	pretty
O	weak
O	stuff
O	around
O	which
O	to
O	raise
O	the
O	protectionist
O	barriers
O	,
O	it
O	may
O	be
O	because
O	these
O	shows
O	need
O	all
O	the
O	protection
O	they
O	can
O	get
O	.

O	European
O	programs
O	usually
O	target
O	only
O	their
O	own
O	local
O	audience
O	,
O	and
O	often
O	only
O	a
O	small
O	portion
O	of
O	that
O	.

O	Mega-hits
O	in
O	Germany
O	or
O	Italy
O	rarely
O	make
O	it
O	even
O	to
O	France
O	or
O	Great
O	Britain
O	,
O	and
O	almost
O	never
O	show
O	up
O	on
O	U.S.
O	screens
O	.

O	Attempts
O	to
O	produce
O	``
O	pan-European
O	''
O	programs
O	have
O	generally
O	resulted
O	in
O	disappointment
O	.

O	One
O	annual
O	co-production
O	,
O	the
O	three-hour-long
O	``
O	Eurovision

O	.

O	Most

O	While
O	some
O	in
O	the
O	U.S.
O	contend
O	that
O	advertising
O	is
O	the
O	bane
O	of
O	television
O	,
O	here
O	many
O	believe
O	that
O	its

O	is
O	to
O	blame
O	for
O	the
O	European
O	TV
O	industry
O	's
O	sluggish
O	development
O	.

O	Until
O	recently
O	,
O	national
O	governments
O	in
O	Europe
O	controlled
O	most
O	of
O	the
O	air
O	time
O	and
O	allowed
O	little
O	or
O	no
O	advertising
O	.

O	Since
O	production
O	costs
O	were
O	guaranteed
O	,
O	it
O	did
O	n't
O	matter
O	that
O	a
O	program
O	could
O	n't
O	be
O	sold
O	abroad
O	or
O	put
O	into
O	syndication
O	,
O	as
O	most
O	American
O	programs
O	are
O	.

O	But
O	not
O	much
O	money
O	was
O	spent
O	on
O	the
O	shows
O	,
O	either
O	,
O	a
O	situation
O	that
O	encouraged
O	cheap-to-make
O	talk
O	and
O	game
O	shows
O	,
O	while
O	discouraging
O	expensive-to-produce
O	dramas
O	.

O	Now
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	commercial
O	channels
O	are
O	coming
O	to
O	most
O	European
O	countries
O	,
O	and
O	at
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	satellite
O	and
O	cable
O	technology
O	is
O	spreading
O	rapidly
O	.

O	Just
O	last
O	week
O	,
O	Greece
O	authorized
O	two
O	commercial
O	channels
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	time

O	Spain
O	earlier
O	began
O	to
O	allow
O	commercial
O	television
O	alongside
O	its
O	state
O	channels
O	.

O	The
O	result
O	is
O	a
O	new
O	and
O	huge
O	appetite
O	for
O	programming
O	.

O	But
O	perhaps
O	to
O	the
O	consternation
O	of
O	those
O	calling
O	for
O	quotas
O	,
O	most
O	of
O	this
O	void
O	is
O	likely
O	to
O	be
O	filled
O	with
O	the
O	cheapest
O	and

O	plentiful

O	divisions
O	,
O	greatly

O	The
O	50-50
O	joint

O	,

O	and
O	would
O	be
O	among
O	the
O	world
O	's
O	largest
O	missile
O	makers
O	.

O	After
O	two
O	years
O	of
O	talks
O	,
O	plans
O	for
O	the
O	venture
O	are
O	sufficiently
O	advanced
O	for
O	the
O	companies
O	to
O	seek
O	French
O	and

O	clearance
O	.

O	The
O	companies
O	hope
O	for
O	a
O	final
O	agreement
O	by
O	year-end
O	.

O	The
O	venture
O	would
O	strengthen

O	between
O	the
O	two

O	,
O	and
O	help
O	make
O	them
O	a
O	leading

O	in
O	European
O	defense

O	In
O	recent
O	months
O	,
O	a
O	string
O	of
O	cross-border
O	mergers
O	and
O	joint
O	ventures
O	have
O	reshaped
O	the
O	once-balkanized
O	world
O	of
O	European
O	arms
O	manufacture
O	.

O	Already
O	,
O	British
O	Aerospace
O	and

O	government-controlled
O	Thomson-CSF
O	collaborate
O	on
O	a
O	British
O	missile
O	contract
O	and
O	on
O	an
O	air-traffic
O	control

O	system
O	.

O	Just

O	The
O	sudden
O	romance
O	of
O	British
O	Aerospace
O	and
O	Thomson-CSF
O	--
O	traditionally
O	bitter
O	competitors
O	for
O	Middle
O	East

O	World
O	weapons
O	contracts
O	--
O	is
O	stirring
O	controversy
O	in
O	Western
O	Europe
O	's
O	defense
O	industry
O	.

O	Most
O	threatened
O	by
O	closer
O	British
O	Aerospace-Thomson
O	ties
O	would
O	be
O	their
O	respective
O	national
O	rivals

O	S.A.
O	in
O	France
O	and
O	Britain
O	's
O	General
O	Electric

O	.

O	But
O	neither
O	Matra
O	nor
O	GEC
O	--
O	unrelated
O	to
O	Stamford
O	,
O	Conn.-based
O	General
O	Electric
O	Co.
O	--
O	are
O	sitting
O	quietly
O	by
O	as
O	their
O	competitors
O	join
O	forces
O	.

O	Yesterday
O	,
O	a
O	source
O	close
O	to
O	GEC
O	confirmed
O	that
O	his
O	company
O	may
O	join
O	the
O	Ferranti
O	fight
O	,
O	as
O	part
O	of
O	a

O	would

O	be
O	weeks

O	and

O	potential
O	partners
O	decide
O	whether
O	to
O	bid
O	,
O	the
O	source
O	indicated
O	.

O	GEC
O	plans
O	first
O	to
O	study
O	Ferranti
O	's
O	financial
O	accounts
O	,
O	which
O	auditors
O	recently

O	with
O	which
O	Ferranti
O	merged
O	last

O	.

O	Also
O	,
O	any
O	GEC
O	bid
O	might
O	be
O	blocked
O	by
O	British
O	antitrust

O	;
O	Ferranti
O	is

O	The

O	Mr.

O	that

O	In

O	The

O	shape
O	the

O	are

O	Population
O	Drain
O	Ends
O	For
O	Midwestern
O	States

O	IOWA
O	IS
O	MAKING
O	a
O	comeback
O	.

O	So
O	are
O	Indiana
O	,
O	Ohio
O	and
O	Michigan
O	.

O	The
O	population
O	of
O	all
O	four
O	states
O	is
O	on
O	the
O	upswing
O	,
O	according
O	to
O	new
O	Census
O	Bureau
O	estimates
O	,
O	following
O	declines
O	throughout
O	the
O	early
O	1980s
O	.

O	The
O	gains
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	sure
O	,
O	are
O	rather
O	small
O	.

O	Iowa
O	,
O	for
O	instance
O	,
O	saw
O	its
O	population
O	grow
O	by
O	11,000
O	people
O	,
O	or
O	0.4
O	%
O	,
O	between
O	1987
O	and
O	1988
O	,
O	the
O	Census
O	Bureau
O	says
O	.

O	Still
O	,
O	even
O	that
O	modest
O	increase
O	is
O	good
O	news
O	for
O	a
O	state
O	that
O	had
O	n't
O	grown
O	at
O	all
O	since
O	1981
O	.

O	Between
O	1987
O	and
O	1988
O	,
O	North
O	Dakota
O	was
O	the
O	only
O	state
O	in
O	the
O	Midwest
O	to
O	lose
O	population
O	,
O	a
O	loss
O	of
O	4,000
O	people
O	.

O	Six
O	of
O	the
O	12
O	midwestern
O	states
O	have
O	been
O	growing
O	steadily
O	since
O	1980
O	--
O	Illinois
O	,
O	Kansas
O	,
O	Minnesota
O	,
O	Missouri
O	,
O	South
O	Dakota
O	and
O	Wisconsin
O	.

O	The
O	Northeast
O	has
O	been
O	holding
O	its
O	own
O	in
O	the
O	population
O	race
O	.

O	Seven
O	of
O	nine
O	states
O	have
O	grown
O	each
O	year
O	since
O	1980
O	,
O	including
O	New
O	York
O	,
O	which
O	lost
O	4
O	%
O	of
O	its
O	population
O	during
O	the
O	1970s
O	.

O	And
O	although
O	Pennsylvania
O	and
O	Massachusetts
O	suffered
O	slight
O	declines
O	earlier
O	in
O	the
O	decade
O	,
O	they
O	are
O	growing
O	again
O	.

O	At
O	the
O	same
O	time
O	,
O	several
O	states
O	in
O	the
O	South
O	and
O	West
O	have
O	had
O	their
O	own
O	population
O	turnaround
O	.

O	Seven
O	states
O	that
O	grew
O	in
O	the
O	early
O	1980s
O	are
O	now
O	losing
O	population
O	--
O	West
O	Virginia
O	,
O	Mississippi
O	,
O	Louisiana
O	,
O	Oklahoma
O	,
O	Montana
O	,
O	Wyoming
O	and
O	Alaska
O	.

O	Overall
O	,
O	though
O	,
O	the
O	South
O	and
O	West
O	still
O	outpace
O	the
O	Northeast
O	and
O	Midwest
O	,
O	and
O	fast-growing
O	states
O	like
O	Florida
O	and
O	California
O	ensure
O	that
O	the
O	pattern
O	will
O	continue
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	growth
O	gap
O	between
O	the
O	Sun
O	Belt
O	and
O	other
O	regions
O	has
O	clearly
O	started
O	narrowing
O	.

O	More
O	Elderly
O	Maintain
O	Their
O	Independence

O	THANKS
O	TO
O	modern
O	medicine
O	,
O	more
O	couples
O	are
O	growing
O	old
O	together
O	.

O	And
O	even
O	after
O	losing
O	a
O	spouse
O	,
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	elderly
O	are
O	staying
O	independent
O	.

O	A
O	new
O	Census
O	Bureau
O	study
O	of
O	the
O	noninstitutionalized
O	population
O	shows
O	that
O	64
O	%
O	of
O	people
O	aged
O	65
O	to
O	74
O	were
O	living
O	with
O	a
O	spouse
O	in
O	1988
O	,
O	up
O	from
O	59
O	%
O	in
O	1970
O	.

O	This
O	does
O	n't
O	mean
O	they
O	're
O	less
O	likely
O	to
O	live
O	alone
O	,
O	however
O	.

O	That
O	share
O	has
O	remained
O	at
O	about
O	24
O	%
O	since
O	1970
O	.

O	What
O	has
O	changed
O	is
O	that
O	more
O	of
O	the
O	young
O	elderly
O	are
O	living
O	with
O	spouses
O	rather
O	than
O	with
O	other
O	relatives
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	children
O	.

O	In
O	1988
O	,
O	10
O	%
O	of
O	those
O	aged
O	65
O	to
O	74
O	lived
O	with
O	relatives
O	other
O	than
O	spouses
O	,
O	down
O	from
O	15
O	%
O	in
O	1970
O	.

O	As
O	people
O	get
O	even
O	older
O	,
O	many
O	become
O	widowed
O	.

O	But
O	even
O	among
O	those
O	aged
O	75
O	and
O	older
O	,
O	the
O	share
O	living
O	with
O	a
O	spouse
O	rose
O	slightly
O	,
O	to
O	40
O	%
O	in
O	1988
O	from
O	38
O	%
O	in
O	1970
O	.

O	Like
O	their
O	younger
O	counterparts
O	,
O	the
O	older
O	elderly
O	are
O	less
O	likely
O	to
O	live
O	with
O	other
O	relatives
O	.

O	Only
O	17
O	%
O	of
O	those
O	aged
O	75
O	and
O	older
O	lived
O	with
O	relatives
O	other
O	than
O	spouses
O	in
O	1988
O	,
O	down
O	from
O	26
O	%
O	in
O	1970
O	.

O	The
O	likelihood
O	of
O	living
O	alone
O	beyond
O	the
O	age
O	of
O	75
O	has
O	increased
O	to
O	40
O	%
O	from
O	32
O	%
O	.

O	More
O	people
O	are
O	remaining
O	independent
O	longer
O	presumably
O	because
O	they
O	are
O	better
O	off
O	physically
O	and
O	financially
O	.

O	they
O	strongly

O	.

O	Being

O	and
O	spending
O	the
O	money
O	they
O	make
O	are
O	top
O	priorities
O	for

O	.

O	Unlike

O	studies
O	of
O	the
O	affluent

O	,
O	this

O	.

O	Despite

O	,
O	40

O	For

O	-LRB-

O	-RRB-
O	is
O	not

O	Not

O	Mr.

O	the
O	star
O	of
O	``

O	,

O	Here
O	,
O	in
O	neutral
O	language
O	,
O	is
O	the
O	gist
O	of
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	's
O	remarks
O	,
O	quoted
O	first
O	in
O	the
O	Village
O	Voice
O	while
O	he
O	was
O	a
O	paid
O	spokesman
O	for
O	the
O	Rudolph
O	Giuliani
O	mayoral
O	campaign
O	,
O	and
O	then
O	in
O	Newsweek
O	after
O	he
O	and
O	the
O	campaign
O	parted
O	company
O	.

O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	said
O	that
O	many
O	Jewish
O	voters
O	feel
O	guilty
O	toward
O	blacks
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	support
O	black
O	candidates
O	uncritically
O	.

O	He
O	said
O	that
O	many
O	black
O	voters
O	feel
O	bitter
O	about
O	racial
O	discrimination
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	,
O	too
O	,
O	support
O	black
O	candidates
O	uncritically
O	.

O	He
O	said
O	that
O	Jews
O	have
O	contributed
O	more
O	to
O	black
O	causes
O	over
O	the
O	years
O	than
O	vice
O	versa
O	.

O	Of
O	course
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	did
O	not
O	use
O	neutral
O	language
O	.

O	As
O	a
O	practitioner
O	of
O	ethnic
O	humor
O	from
O	the
O	old
O	days
O	on
O	the
O	Borscht
O	Belt
O	,
O	live
O	television
O	and
O	the
O	nightclub
O	circuit
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	instinctively
O	reached
O	for
O	the
O	vernacular
O	.

O	He
O	said
O	Jews
O	were
O	``
O	sick
O	with
O	complexes
O	''
O	;
O	and
O	he
O	called
O	David
O	Dinkins
O	,
O	Mr.
O	Giuliani
O	's
O	black
O	opponent
O	,
O	``
O	a
O	fancy
O	shvartze
O	with
O	a
O	mustache
O	.
O	''

O	If
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	had
O	used
O	less
O	derogatory
O	language
O	to
O	articulate
O	his
O	amateur
O	analysis
O	of
O	the
O	voting
O	behavior
O	of
O	his
O	fellow
O	New
O	Yorkers
O	,
O	would
O	the
O	water
O	be
O	quite
O	so
O	hot
O	?

O	It
O	probably
O	would
O	,
O	because
O	few
O	or
O	none
O	of
O	the
O	people
O	upset
O	by
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	's
O	remarks
O	have
O	bothered
O	to
O	distinguish
O	between
O	the
O	substance
O	of
O	his
O	comments
O	and
O	the
O	fact
O	that
O	he
O	used
O	insulting
O	language
O	.

O	In
O	addition
O	,
O	some
O	of
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	's
O	critics
O	have
O	implied
O	that
O	his
O	type
O	of
O	ethnic
O	humor
O	is
O	itself
O	a
O	form
O	of
O	racism
O	.

O	For
O	example
O	,
O	the
O	New
O	York
O	state
O	counsel
O	for
O	the
O	NAACP
O	said
O	that
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	is
O	``
O	like
O	a
O	dinosaur
O	.

O	People
O	are
O	fast
O	leaving
O	the
O	place
O	where
O	he
O	is
O	stuck
O	.
O	''

O	These
O	critics
O	fail
O	to
O	distinguish
O	between
O	the
O	type
O	of
O	ethnic
O	humor
O	that
O	aims
O	at
O	disparaging
O	another
O	group
O	,
O	such
O	as
O	``
O	Polish
O	jokes
O	''
O	;
O	and
O	the
O	type
O	that
O	is
O	double-edged
O	,
O	aiming
O	inward
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	outward
O	.

O	The
O	latter
O	typically
O	is
O	the
O	humor
O	of
O	the
O	underdog
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	was
O	perfected
O	by
O	both
O	blacks
O	and
O	Jews
O	on
O	the
O	minstrel
O	and
O	vaudeville
O	stage
O	as
O	a
O	means
O	of
O	mocking
O	their
O	white
O	and
O	gentile
O	audiences
O	along
O	with
O	themselves
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	hands
O	of
O	a
O	zealot
O	like
O	Lenny
O	Bruce
O	,
O	this
O	double-edged
O	blade
O	could
O	cut
O	both
O	the
O	self
O	and
O	the
O	audience
O	to
O	ribbons
O	.

O	But
O	wielded
O	by
O	a
O	pro
O	like
O	Jackie
O	Mason
O	,
O	it
O	is
O	a
O	constructive
O	form
O	of
O	mischief
O	.

O	Why
O	constructive
O	?

O	Because
O	despite
O	all
O	the
O	media
O	prattle
O	about
O	comedy
O	and
O	politics
O	not
O	mixing
O	,
O	they
O	are
O	similar
O	in
O	one
O	respect
O	:
O	Both
O	can
O	serve
O	as
O	mechanisms
O	for
O	easing
O	tensions
O	and
O	facilitating
O	the
O	co-existence
O	of
O	groups
O	in
O	conflict
O	.

O	That
O	's
O	why
O	it
O	's
O	dangerous
O	to
O	have
O	well-intentioned
O	thought
O	police
O	,
O	on
O	college
O	campuses
O	and
O	elsewhere
O	,
O	taboo
O	all
O	critical
O	mention
O	of
O	group
O	differences
O	.

O	As
O	Elizabeth
O	Kristol
O	wrote
O	in
O	the
O	New
O	York
O	Times
O	just
O	before

O	The
O	question
O	is
O	,
O	if
O	group
O	conflicts
O	still
O	exist
O	-LRB-
O	as
O	undeniably
O	they
O	do
O	-RRB-
O	,
O	and
O	if
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	's
O	type
O	of
O	ethnic
O	humor
O	is
O	passe
O	,
O	then
O	what
O	other
O	means
O	do
O	we
O	have
O	for
O	letting
O	off
O	steam
O	?

O	Do
O	n't
O	say
O	the
O	TV
O	sitcom
O	,
O	because
O	that
O	happens
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	genre
O	that
O	,
O	in
O	its
O	desperate
O	need
O	to
O	attract
O	everybody
O	and
O	offend
O	nobody
O	,
O	resembles
O	politics
O	more
O	than
O	it
O	does
O	comedy
O	.

O	It
O	is
O	true
O	that
O	the
O	best
O	sitcoms
O	do
O	allow
O	group
O	differences
O	to
O	simmer
O	:
O	yuppies
O	vs.
O	blue-collar
O	Bostonians
O	in
O	``
O	Cheers
O	''
O	;
O	children
O	vs.
O	adults
O	in
O	``
O	The
O	Cosby
O	Show
O	.
O	''

O	But
O	these
O	are
O	not
O	the
O	differences
O	that
O	make
O	headlines
O	.

O	In
O	``
O	Chicken
O	Soup
O	,
O	''
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	plays
O	Jackie
O	,
O	a
O	Jewish
O	bachelor
O	courting
O	Maddie
O	-LRB-
O	Lynn
O	Redgrave
O	-RRB-
O	,
O	an
O	Irish
O	widow
O	and
O	mother
O	of
O	three
O	,
O	against
O	the
O	wishes
O	of
O	his
O	mother
O	-LRB-
O	Rita
O	Karin
O	-RRB-
O	and
O	her
O	brother
O	Michael
O	-LRB-
O	Brandon
O	Maggart
O	-RRB-
O	.

O	It
O	's
O	worth
O	noting
O	that
O	both
O	disapproving
O	relatives
O	are
O	immigrants
O	.

O	At
O	least
O	,
O	they
O	both
O	speak
O	with
O	strong
O	accents
O	,
O	as
O	do
O	Jackie
O	and
O	Maddie
O	.

O	It
O	could
O	n't
O	be
O	more
O	obvious
O	that
O	``
O	Chicken
O	Soup
O	''
O	is
O	being
O	made
O	from
O	an
O	old
O	recipe
O	.

O	And
O	a
O	safe
O	one
O	--
O	imagine
O	if
O	the
O	romance
O	in
O	question
O	were
O	between
O	an
O	Orthodox
O	Jew
O	and
O	a
O	member
O	of
O	the
O	Nation
O	of
O	Islam
O	.

O	Back
O	in
O	the
O	1920s
O	,
O	the
O	play
O	and
O	movie
O	versions
O	of
O	``
O	Abie
O	's
O	Irish
O	Rose
O	''
O	made
O	the
O	theme
O	of
O	courtship
O	between
O	the
O	assimilated
O	offspring
O	of
O	Jewish
O	and
O	Irish
O	immigrants
O	so
O	popular
O	that
O	its
O	author
O	,
O	Anne
O	Nichols
O	,
O	lost
O	a
O	plagiarism
O	suit
O	on
O	the
O	grounds
O	that
O	the
O	plot
O	has
O	entered
O	the
O	public
O	domain
O	.

O	And
O	it
O	has
O	remained
O	there
O	,
O	as
O	evidenced
O	by
O	its
O	reappearance
O	in
O	a
O	1972
O	CBS
O	sitcom
O	called
O	``
O	Bridget
O	Loves
O	Bernie
O	,
O	''
O	whose
O	sole
O	distinction
O	was
O	that
O	it
O	led
O	to
O	the
O	real-life
O	marriage
O	of
O	Meredith
O	Baxter
O	and
O	David
O	Birney
O	.

O	Clearly
O	,
O	the
O	question
O	with
O	``
O	Chicken
O	Soup
O	''
O	is
O	not
O	whether
O	the
O	pot
O	will
O	boil
O	over
O	,
O	but
O	whether
O	it
O	will
O	simmer
O	at
O	all
O	.

O	So
O	far
O	,
O	the
O	bubbles
O	have
O	been
O	few
O	and
O	far
O	between
O	.

O	Part
O	of
O	the
O	problem
O	is
O	the
O	tendency
O	of
O	all
O	sitcoms
O	,
O	ever
O	since
O	the
O	didactic
O	days
O	of
O	Norman
O	Lear
O	,
O	to
O	preach
O	about
O	social
O	issues
O	.

O	To
O	some
O	extent
O	,
O	this
O	tendency
O	emerges
O	whenever
O	the
O	show
O	tries
O	to
O	enlighten
O	us
O	about
O	ethnic
O	stereotypes
O	by
O	reversing
O	them
O	.

O	For
O	instance
O	,
O	Michael
O	dislikes
O	Jackie
O	not
O	because
O	he
O	's
O	a
O	shrewd
O	Jewish
O	businessman
O	,
O	but
O	because
O	he
O	quits
O	his
O	well-paying
O	job
O	as
O	a
O	salesman
O	in
O	order
O	to
O	become
O	a
O	social
O	worker
O	.

O	Even
O	more
O	problematic
O	is
O	the
O	incompatibility
O	between
O	sitcom
O	preachiness
O	and
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	's
O	comic
O	persona
O	.

O	The
O	best
O	moments
O	in
O	the
O	show
O	occur
O	at
O	the
O	beginning
O	and
O	the
O	end
O	-LRB-
O	and
O	occasionally
O	in
O	the
O	middle
O	-RRB-
O	,
O	when
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	slips
O	into
O	his
O	standup
O	mode
O	and
O	starts
O	meting
O	out
O	that
O	old-fashioned
O	Jewish
O	mischief
O	to
O	other
O	people
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	to
O	himself
O	.

O	But
O	too
O	often
O	,
O	these
O	routines
O	lack
O	spark
O	because
O	this
O	sitcom
O	,
O	like
O	all
O	sitcoms
O	,
O	is
O	timid
O	about
O	confronting
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	's
O	stock
O	in
O	trade
O	-
O	ethnic
O	differences
O	.

O	I
O	'm
O	not
O	suggesting
O	that
O	the
O	producers
O	start
O	putting
O	together
O	episodes
O	about
O	topics
O	like
O	the
O	Catholic-Jewish
O	dispute
O	over
O	the
O	Carmelite
O	convent
O	at
O	Auschwitz
O	.

O	That
O	issue
O	,
O	like
O	racial
O	tensions
O	in
O	New
O	York
O	City
O	,
O	will
O	have
O	to
O	cool
O	down
O	,
O	not
O	heat
O	up
O	,
O	before
O	it
O	can
O	simmer
O	.

O	But
O	I
O	am
O	suggesting
O	that
O	they
O	stop
O	requiring
O	Mr.
O	Mason
O	to
O	interrupt
O	his
O	classic
O	shtik
O	with
O	some
O	line
O	about
O	``
O	caring
O	for
O	other
O	people
O	''
O	that
O	would
O	sound
O	shmaltzy
O	on
O	the
O	lips
O	of
O	Miss
O	America

O	One
O	obvious
O	place
O	to
O	attach

O	capital-gains
O	tax
O	cut
O	,
O	and
O	perhaps
O	other
O	popular
O	items
O	stripped
O	from
O	the
O	deficit-reduction
O	bill
O	,
O	is
O	the
O	legislation
O	to
O	raise
O	the
O	federal
O	borrowing

O	.

O	Such
O	legislation
O	must
O	be
O	enacted
O	by
O	the
O	end
O	of
O	the
O	month
O	.

O	The
O	Senate
O	bill
O	was
O	pared
O	back
O	in
O	an
O	attempt
O	to
O	speed
O	deficit-reduction
O	through
O	Congress
O	.

O	Because
O	the
O	legislation
O	has
O	n't
O	been
O	completed
O	,
O	President

O	has
O	until
O	midnight
O	tonight

O	across-the-board
O	spending
O	cuts
O	mandated
O	by
O	the

O	Senators

O	The

O	Another
O	big
O	question
O	hovering
O	over
O	the
O	debate
O	is
O	what
O	President
O	Bush
O	thinks
O	.

O	He
O	has
O	been
O	resisting
O	a
O	stripped-down
O	bill
O	without
O	a
O	guaranteed
O	vote
O	on
O	his
O	capital-gains
O	tax
O	cut
O	.

O	But
O	Republican
O	senators
O	saw
O	no
O	way
O	to
O	overcome
O	a
O	procedural
O	hurdle
O	and
O	garner
O	the
O	60
O	votes
O	needed
O	to
O	win
O	the
O	capital-gains
O	issue
O	on
O	the
O	floor
O	,
O	so
O	they
O	went
O	ahead
O	with
O	the
O	streamlined
O	bill
O	.

O	The
O	Senate
O	bill
O	was
O	stripped
O	of
O	many
O	popular
O	,
O	though
O	revenue-losing
O	,
O	provisions
O	,
O	a
O	number
O	of
O	which
O	are
O	included
O	in
O	the
O	House-passed
O	bill
O	.

O	These
O	include
O	a
O	child-care
O	initiative
O	and
O	extensions
O	of
O	soon-to-expire
O	tax
O	breaks
O	for
O	low-income
O	housing
O	and
O	research-and-development
O	expenditures
O	.

O	Also
O	missing
O	from
O	the
O	Senate
O	bill
O	is
O	the
O	House
O	's
O	repeal
O	of
O	a
O	law
O	,
O	called
O	Section
O	89
O	,
O	that
O	compels
O	companies
O	to
O	give
O	rank-and-file
O	workers
O	comparable
O	health
O	benefits
O	to
O	top
O	paid
O	executives
O	.

O	One
O	high-profile
O	provision
O	that
O	was
O	originally
O	in
O	the
O	Senate
O	bill
O	but
O	was
O	cut
O	out
O	because
O	it
O	lost

O	.

O	Mr.
O	Bentsen
O	said
O	he
O	hopes
O	the
O	Senate
O	will
O	consider
O	that
O	measure
O	soon
O	.

O	To
O	the
O	delight
O	of
O	some
O	doctors
O	,
O	the
O	bill
O	dropped
O	a
O	plan
O	passed
O	by
O	the
O	Finance
O	Committee
O	that
O	would
O	have
O	overhauled
O	the
O	entire

O	Sen.

O	sacrifice

O	every

O	It
O	worked
O	,
O	others
O	said
O	,
O	because
O	there
O	were
O	no
O	exceptions
O	:
O	all
O	revenue-losing
O	provisions
O	were
O	stricken
O	.

O	The
O	Senate
O	also
O	dropped
O	a
O	plan
O	by
O	its
O	Finance
O	Committee
O	that
O	would
O	have
O	increased

O	income
O	threshold

O	which
O	senior
O	citizens
O	have
O	their
O	Social
O	Security
O	benefits
O	reduced

O	In
O	addition
O	,
O	the

O	dropped
O	a
O	plan
O	to
O	make
O	permanent
O	a
O	3
O	%
O	excise
O	tax
O	on
O	long-distance
O	telephone
O	calls
O	.

O	It
O	no
O	longer
O	includes
O	a
O	plan
O	that
O	would
O	have
O	repealed
O	what
O	remains
O	of
O	the
O	completed-contract
O	method
O	of
O	accounting
O	,
O	which
O	is
O	used
O	by
O	military
O	contractors
O	to
O	reduce
O	their
O	tax
O	burden
O	.

O	It
O	also
O	drops
O	a
O	provision
O	that
O	would
O	have
O	permitted
O	corporations
O	to
O	use
O	excess
O	pension
O	funds
O	to
O	pay
O	health
O	benefits
O	for
O	current
O	retirees
O	.

O	Also
O	stricken
O	was
O	a
O	fivefold
O	increase
O	in
O	the
O	maximum
O	Occupational
O	Safety
O	and
O	Health
O	Administration
O	penalties

O	provision
O	that
O	would
O	have
O	made
O	the
O	Social
O	Security
O	Administration
O	an
O	independent
O	agency

O	excised

O	,

O	so
O	rightly
O	pointed
O	out
O	in

O	,
O	who
O	after
O	all
O	is
O	really
O	a
O	bit
O	player
O	on
O	the
O	stage
O	,
O	but
O	the
O	attempt
O	by
O	Congress
O	to
O	enhance
O	itself
O	into
O	a

O	body
O	.

O	-LRB-
O	Of

O	,
O	we
O	've
O	also
O	got
O	a

O	that
O	seeks
O	the
O	same
O	objective
O	.
O	-RRB-

O	The
O	system
O	is
O	the
O	problem
O	,
O	not
O	an
O	individual
O	member
O	.

O	Individuals
O	can
O	always
O	have
O	their
O	hands
O	slapped
O	.

O	It
O	's
O	when
O	such
O	slapping
O	does
O	n't
O	occur
O	that
O	we
O	've
O	got
O	trouble
O	.

O	I
O	do
O	not
O	by
O	any
O	means
O	defend
O	HUD
O	management
O	.

O	But
O	I
O	think
O	the
O	kind
O	of
O	congressional
O	investigation
O	that
O	has
O	been
O	pursued
O	is
O	a
O	far
O	greater
O	danger
O	to
O	American
O	notions
O	of
O	liberty
O	and
O	freedom
O	than
O	any
O	incompetency
O	-LRB-
O	and
O	,
O	yes
O	,
O	maybe
O	criminality
O	-RRB-
O	within
O	HUD
O	could
O	possibly
O	generate
O	.

O	The
O	last
O	time
O	I
O	saw
O	a
O	similar
O	congressional
O	hearing
O	was
O	when
O	``
O	Tail

O	McCarthy
O	did
O	his
O	work
O	.

O	Raymond
O	Weber

O	,
O	N.J
O	.

O	I
O	disagree
O	with
O	the
O	statement
O	by
O	Mr.
O	Lantos
O	that
O	one
O	should
O	not
O	draw
O	an
O	adverse
O	inference
O	against
O	former
O	HUD
O	officials
O	who
O	assert
O	their
O	Fifth
O	Amendment
O	privilege
O	against
O	self-incrimination
O	in
O	congressional
O	hearings
O	.

O	The
O	Fifth
O	Amendment
O	states
O	in
O	relevant
O	part
O	that
O	no
O	person
O	``
O	shall
O	be
O	compelled
O	,
O	in
O	any
O	criminal
O	case
O	,
O	to
O	be
O	a
O	witness
O	against
O	himself
O	.
O	''

O	This
O	privilege
O	against
O	self-incrimination
O	precludes
O	the
O	drawing
O	of
O	an
O	adverse
O	inference
O	against
O	a
O	criminal
O	defendant
O	who
O	chooses
O	not
O	to
O	testify
O	.

O	Thus
O	,
O	in
O	a
O	criminal
O	case
O	,
O	a
O	prosecutor
O	can
O	not
O	comment
O	on
O	a
O	defendant
O	's
O	failure
O	to
O	testify
O	nor
O	can
O	the
O	defendant
O	be
O	compelled
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	stand
O	as
O	a
O	witness
O	,
O	thus
O	forcing
O	him
O	to
O	``
O	take
O	the
O	Fifth
O	.
O	''

O	The
O	privilege
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	has
O	been
O	limited
O	in
O	accordance
O	with
O	its
O	plain
O	language
O	to
O	protect
O	the
O	defendant
O	in
O	criminal
O	matters
O	only
O	.

O	The
O	Supreme
O	Court
O	and
O	some
O	states
O	have
O	specifically
O	recognized
O	that
O	``
O	the
O	ÕFifthå
O	Amendment
O	does
O	not
O	preclude
O	the
O	inference
O	where
O	the
O	privilege
O	is
O	claimed
O	by
O	a
O	party
O	to
O	a
O	civil

O	a

O	may
O	be
O	called
O	as

O	Allowing
O	the
O	defendant
O	to
O	take
O	the
O	Fifth
O	in
O	a
O	civil
O	matter
O	is
O	not
O	based
O	on

O	Absent
O	the

O	,
O	a

O	,

O	The

O	,

O	found

O	But
O	,
O	with

O	Mr.

O	plans

O	of
O	a
O	widely
O	employed
O	anti-takeover
O	defense
O	of
O	companies
O	in

O	.

O	The
O	eventual
O	court
O	decision
O	could
O	become
O	a
O	landmark
O	in
O	Dutch
O	corporate
O	law
O	because
O	the
O	lawsuit
O	ASKO
O	plans
O	to

O	would
O	be
O	the

O	Should
O	the

O	uphold
O	the

O	of
O	this

O	of
O	defense
O	,
O	ASKO
O	will
O	then
O	ask
O	the
O	court
O	to

O	such
O	a
O	vote-diluting
O	maneuver
O	recently
O	deployed
O	by
O	Koninklijke
O	Ahold
O	NV
O	.

O	ASKO
O	says
O	the
O	Dutch-based
O	international
O	food
O	retailer
O	had
O	n't
O	reasonable
O	grounds
O	to
O	issue
O	preferred
O	stock
O	to
O	a

O	thus
O	dilute
O	the
O	worth
O	and
O	voting
O	power
O	of
O	ASKO
O	and
O	other
O	shareholders
O	.

O	Speaking
O	through
O	its
O	Dutch
O	lawyers
O	,
O	ASKO
O	also
O	disclosed
O	it
O	holds
O	a
O	15
O	%
O	stake
O	in
O	Ahold
O	.

O	It
O	was
O	previously
O	thought
O	ASKO
O	held
O	a
O	13.6

O	stake
O	that
O	was
O	accumulated
O	since

O	position
O	and
O	the

O	The

O	has
O	sent
O	out
O	confusing
O	signals
O	about
O	its
O	response
O	to
O	a
O	recent
O	spate
O	of
O	airline
O	takeovers
O	.

O	Last
O	month
O	,
O	Transportation
O	Secretary
O	Sam
O	Skinner
O	forced
O	Northwest
O	Airlines
O	to
O	reduce
O	a
O	stake
O	held
O	by
O	KLM
O	Royal
O	Dutch
O	Airlines
O	.

O	But
O	he
O	has
O	since
O	run
O	into
O	opposition
O	from
O	the
O	Treasury
O	and
O	the
O	White
O	House
O	over
O	that
O	decision
O	.

O	And
O	he
O	has
O	kept
O	mum
O	on
O	how
O	his
O	decision
O	might
O	affect
O	a
O	bid
O	for
O	United
O	Airlines
O	,
O	which
O	includes
O	a
O	big
O	stake
O	by
O	British
O	Airways
O	PLC
O	.

O	Some
O	analysts
O	say
O	uncertainty
O	about
O	Washington
O	's
O	anti-takeover
O	policy
O	was
O	one
O	reason
O	that
O	financing
O	for
O	the
O	United
O	Airlines
O	takeover
O	fell
O	through
O	--
O	the
O	event
O	that
O	triggered
O	the
O	market
O	drop
O	.

O	In
O	many
O	ways
O	,
O	the
O	backdrop
O	to
O	Friday
O	's
O	stock
O	decline
O	is
O	eerily
O	similar
O	to
O	that
O	of
O	October
O	1987
O	's
O	508-point
O	crash
O	.

O	Then
O	,
O	as
O	now
O	,
O	the
O	budget
O	debate
O	was
O	behind
O	schedule
O	and
O	automatic
O	spending
O	cuts
O	were
O	within
O	days
O	of
O	taking
O	hold
O	.

O	The
O	Treasury
O	was
O	locked
O	in
O	a
O	battle
O	over
O	international
O	economic
O	policy
O	,
O	although
O	at
O	that
O	time
O	it
O	was
O	with
O	West
O	German
O	officials
O	rather
O	than
O	the
O	Federal
O	Reserve
O	.

O	And
O	concern
O	about
O	official
O	actions
O	aimed
O	at
O	takeovers
O	--
O	then
O	by
O	the
O	tax-writing
O	House
O	Ways
O	and
O	Means
O	Committee
O	rather
O	than
O	the
O	Transportation
O	Department
O	--
O	were
O	making
O	markets
O	nervous
O	.

O	The
O	1987
O	crash
O	brought
O	the
O	Reagan
O	administration
O	and
O	Democratic
O	lawmakers
O	to
O	the
O	table
O	for
O	the
O	first
O	budget
O	summit
O	,
O	resulting
O	in
O	a
O	two-year
O	plan
O	to
O	reduce
O	the
O	deficit
O	by
O	more
O	than
O	$
O	76
O	billion
O	--
O	even
O	though
O	the
O	deficit
O	actually
O	rose
O	by
O	nearly
O	$
O	12
O	billion
O	during
O	that
O	period
O	.

O	But
O	,
O	barring
O	further
O	drops
O	in
O	the
O	market
O	this
O	week
O	,
O	a
O	similar
O	outcome
O	does
O	n't
O	seem
O	likely
O	this
O	year
O	.

O	Lawmakers
O	and
O	administration
O	officials
O	agree
O	that
O	Friday
O	's
O	drop
O	,
O	by
O	itself
O	,
O	is
O	n't
O	enough
O	to
O	force
O	both
O	sides
O	back
O	to
O	the
O	table
O	to
O	try
O	to
O	reach
O	a
O	deficit-reduction
O	agreement
O	that
O	would
O	be
O	more
O	serious
O	and
O	more
O	far-reaching
O	than
O	last
O	spring
O	's
O	gimmick-ridden
O	plan
O	,
O	which
O	still
O	is
O	n't
O	fully
O	implemented
O	.

O	One
O	of
O	the
O	biggest
O	reasons
O	that
O	new
O	talks
O	are
O	n't
O	likely
O	to
O	come
O	about
O	is
O	that
O	,
O	as
O	everyone
O	learned
O	in
O	1987
O	,
O	the
O	economy
O	and
O	the
O	market
O	can
O	survive
O	a
O	one-day
O	508-point
O	tumble
O	.

O	The

O	advised

O	last

O	luxury-car

O	General
O	Motors
O	Corp.
O	said
O	it
O	had
O	discussed
O	the
O	possibility
O	of
O	a
O	joint
O	venture
O	with
O	Jaguar
O	before
O	Ford
O	began
O	buying
O	shares
O	.

O	GM
O	said
O	it
O	still
O	is
O	talking
O	with
O	Jaguar
O	about
O	acquiring
O	a
O	minority
O	interest
O	.


O	Investors
O	who
O	bought
O	stock
O	with
O	borrowed
O	money
O	--
O	that
O	is
O	,
O	``
O	on
O	margin
O	''
O	--
O	may
O	be
O	more
O	worried
O	than
O	most
O	following
O	Friday
O	's
O	market
O	drop
O	.

O	That
O	's
O	because
O	their
O	brokers
O	can
O	require
O	them
O	to
O	sell
O	some
O	shares
O	or
O	put
O	up
O	more
O	cash
O	to
O	enhance
O	the
O	collateral
O	backing
O	their
O	loans
O	.

O	In
O	October
O	1987
O	,
O	these
O	margin
O	calls
O	were
O	thought
O	to
O	have
O	contributed
O	to
O	the
O	downward
O	spiral
O	of
O	the
O	stock
O	market
O	.

O	Typically
O	,
O	a
O	margin
O	call
O	occurs
O	when
O	the
O	price
O	of
O	a
O	stock
O	falls
O	below
O	75
O	%
O	of
O	its
O	original
O	value
O	.

O	If
O	the
O	investor
O	does
O	n't
O	put
O	up
O	the
O	extra
O	cash
O	to
O	satisfy
O	the
O	call
O	,
O	the
O	brokerage
O	firm
O	may
O	begin
O	liquidating
O	the
O	securities
O	.

O	But
O	some
O	big
O	brokerage
O	firms
O	said
O	they
O	do
O	n't
O	expect
O	major
O	problems
O	as
O	a
O	result
O	of
O	margin
O	calls
O	.

O	Margin
O	calls
O	since
O	Friday
O	``

O	been
O	higher
O	than

O	,
O	but
O	reasonable

O	.

O	``

O	roughly
O	three

O	Mr.
O	Weiss
O	.

O	But
O	Mr.

O	questions
O	whether
O	that
O	will

I-CONTENT	''
O	he
O	said
O	.

O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	Tandem
O	faces
O	a
O	variety
O	of
O	challenges
O	,
O	the
O	biggest
O	being
O	that
O	customers
O	generally
O	view
O	the
O	company
O	's
O	computers
O	as
O	complementary
O	to
O	IBM
O	's
O	mainframes
O	.

O	Even
O	Mr.
O	Treybig
O	is
O	reluctant
O	to
O	abandon
O	this
O	notion
O	,
O	insisting
O	that
O	Tandem
O	's
O	new
O	machines
O	are
O	n't
O	replacements
O	for
O	IBM
O	's
O	mainframes
O	.

O	Do
O	n't
O	jump
O	yet
O	.

O	The
O	stock
O	market
O	's
O	swoon
O	may
O	turn
O	out
O	to
O	be
O	good
O	news
O	for
O	the
O	economy
O	.

O	In
O	one
O	wild
O	hour
O	of
O	trading
O	,
O	the
O	market
O	managed
O	to
O	accomplish
O	what
O	the
O	Bush
O	administration
O	has
O	been
O	trying
O	to
O	do
O	,
O	unsuccessfully
O	,
O	for
O	weeks
O	.

O	It
O	is
O	forcing
O	the
O	Federal
O	Reserve
O	to
O	ease
O	its
O	grip
O	on
O	credit
O	and
O	it
O	took
O	the
O	wind
O	out
O	of
O	a
O	previously
O	irrepressible
O	dollar
O	.

O	The
O	resulting
O	decline
O	in
O	interest
O	rates
O	and
O	the
O	value
O	of
O	the
O	dollar
O	could
O	reinvigorate
O	American
O	business
O	--
O	indeed
O	,
O	the
O	entire
O	economy
O	.

O	This
O	may
O	sound
O	strangely
O	optimistic
O	.

O	After
O	all
O	,
O	until
O	a
O	few
O	years
O	ago
O	,
O	the
O	stock
O	market
O	was
O	viewed
O	as
O	a
O	barometer
O	of
O	the
O	national
O	economy
O	.

O	When
O	it
O	went
O	down
O	,
O	by
O	all
O	tradition
O	,
O	the
O	economy
O	followed
O	.

O	That
O	has
O	changed
O	,
O	partly
O	because
O	the
O	two
O	years
O	following
O	the
O	worst
O	stock-market
O	plunge
O	in
O	history
O	have
O	been
O	reasonably
O	comfortable

O	The

O	says

O	now
O	relies
O	for

O	sustenance
O	.

O	The
O	financial-services
O	industry
O	was
O	battered
O	by
O	the
O	1987
O	crash
O	.

O	What
O	's
O	more
O	,
O	although
O	the
O	stock
O	market
O	is
O	far
O	less
O	overvalued
O	today
O	than
O	two
O	years
O	ago
O	,
O	the
O	U.S.

O	is
O	weaker

O	Growth
O	is
O	slower
O	.

O	Profits
O	are
O	softer

O	But
O	if

O	continue
O	to
O	plummet
O	,
O	the
O	beneficial
O	effects
O	of
O	lower
O	interest
O	rates
O	and
O	a
O	lower
O	dollar
O	may
O	well
O	dominate
O	.

O	The
O	Fed
O	,
O	which
O	until
O	Friday
O	had
O	been
O	resisting
O	moves
O	to
O	ease
O	credit
O	,
O	is
O	now
O	poised

O	pour
O	money
O	into
O	the
O	economy
O	if
O	needed
O	to
O	soothe
O	the
O	markets
O	.

O	Fed
O	officials
O	may
O	protest
O	that
O	this
O	does
O	n't
O	necessarily
O	mean
O	a
O	fundamental
O	change
O	in
O	their
O	interest-rate
O	policies
O	.

O	But
O	the
O	experience
O	of
O	the
O	1987
O	crash
O	suggests
O	the
O	Fed
O	is
O	likely
O	to
O	bring
O	down
O	short-term
O	interest
O	rates
O	in
O	its
O	effort
O	to
O	calm
O	markets
O	.

O	Anticipating
O	the
O	Fed
O	's
O	move
O	,
O	money
O	traders
O	lowered

O	known

O	,
O	down
O	from

O	The
O	dollar
O	also
O	began
O	to
O	decline
O	Friday
O	as
O	the
O	stock
O	market
O	's
O	plunge
O	caused
O	some

O	to
O	reassess
O	their
O	desire
O	to
O	invest
O	in
O	the
O	U.S.

O	Treasury
O	officials
O	have
O	been
O	arguing
O	for
O	months
O	that
O	the
O	dollar
O	's
O	strength
O	was
O	out
O	of
O	whack
O	with
O	economic
O	fundamentals
O	,
O	threatening
O	to
O	extinguish
O	the
O	export
O	boom
O	that
O	has
O	sustained
O	manufacturers
O	for
O	several
O	years
O	.

O	The
O	market
O	drop
O	has
O	now
O	apparently
O	convinced
O	foreign
O	investors
O	that
O	the
O	Treasury
O	was
O	right
O	about
O	the
O	overpriced
O	dollar
O	.

O	A
O	modest
O	drop
O	in
O	the
O	dollar
O	--
O	only
O	a
O	modest
O	one
O	,
O	mind
O	you
O	--
O	would
O	be
O	welcomed
O	by
O	the
O	U.S.

O	That
O	was
O	n't
O	the
O	case
O	in
O	1987
O	,
O	when
O	the
O	dollar
O	was
O	so
O	weak
O	that
O	some
O	economists
O	and
O	government
O	officials
O	seriously
O	worried
O	that
O	it
O	might
O	collapse
O	,
O	producing
O	panic
O	among
O	foreign
O	investors
O	and
O	diminishing
O	the
O	flow
O	of
O	foreign
O	capital
O	to
O	the
O	U.S.

O	Another
O	big
O	difference
O	between
O	1987

O	1989
O	is
O	n't
O	so

O	The

O	borrowed
O	money
O	,
O	the
O	greater
O	its
O	sensitivity
O	to
O	an
O	economic
O	slowdown
O	.

O	A
O	company
O	with
O	a
O	strong

O	can
O	withstand
O	an
O	unanticipated
O	storm
O	;
O	a
O	highly
O	leveraged
O	company
O	may
O	end
O	up
O	in
O	bankruptcy
O	court
O	.

O	The
O	Fed
O	,
O	of
O	course
O	,
O	knows
O	that
O	very
O	well
O	--
O	hence
O	its
O	readiness
O	to
O	pump
O	credit
O	into
O	the
O	economy
O	this
O	morning
O	.

O	But
O	,
O	in
O	the
O	process
O	,
O	the
O	Fed
O	risks
O	reigniting
O	inflation
O	.

O	Even
O	before
O	Friday
O	's
O	events
O	,
O	Harvard
O	University
O	economist
O	Benjamin
O	Friedman
O	was
O	arguing
O	that
O	the
O	Fed
O	wo
O	n't
O	be
O	able
O	to
O	live
O	up
O	to
O	its
O	tough
O	words
O	on
O	eliminating
O	inflation
O	because
O	of
O	its
O	responsibility
O	to
O	protect
O	fragile
O	financial
O	markets
O	,
O	banks
O	and
O	highly
O	leveraged
O	corporations
O	.

O	The
O	biggest
O	threat
O	on
O	the
O	economic
O	horizon
O	right
O	now
O	is
O	n't
O	recession
O	,
O	he
O	reasons
O	;
O	it
O	's
O	an
O	outbreak
O	of
O	uncontrolled
O	inflation
O	.

O	In
O	the
O	end
O	,
O	the
O	1987
O	collapse
O	suggested
O	,
O	the
O	economy
O	does
O	n't
O	move
O	in
O	lockstep
O	with
O	stock
O	prices
O	.

O	The
O	economy
O	does
O	,
O	however
O	,
O	depend
O	on
O	the
O	confidence
O	of
O	businesses
O	,
O	consumers
O	and
O	foreign
O	investors
O	.

O	A
O	panic
O	on
O	Wall
O	Street
O	does
O	n't
O	exactly
O	inspire
O	confidence
O	.

O	Surveys
O	suggested
O	that
O	consumer
O	confidence
O	was
O	high
O	before
O	Friday
O	.

O	A
O	190-point
O	drop
O	is
O	n't
O	likely
O	to
O	make
O	much
O	of
O	a
O	dent
O	;
O	multiply
O	that
O	a
O	few
O	times
O	over
O	,
O	though
O	,
O	and
O	it
O	will
O	.

O	If
O	the

O	of

O	,
O	for

O	were
O	n't
O	overly
O	rattled
O	by
O	Friday
O	's
O	decline
O	.

O	And
O	if
O	foreign
O	investors
O	become
O	a
O	tad
O	more
O	cautious
O	--
O	well
O	,
O	the
O	dollar
O	's
O	recent
O	strength
O	suggests
O	that
O	the
O	U.S.
O	can
O	stand
O	it
O	.

O	On
O	the
O	bottom
O	line
O	,
O	the
O	most
O	comforting
O	fact
O	for
O	the
O	economic
O	outlook
O	is
O	that
O	we
O	've
O	been
O	through
O	this
O	before

O	Two
O	years
O	ago
O	,
O	about

O	and
O	the
O	subsequent

O	.

O	The

O	had
O	a

O	.

O	The
O	prosperity
O	that
O	followed
O	Black
O	Monday
O	permits
O	a
O	more
O	optimistic
O	view
O	today
O	.

O	At

O	,
O	the
